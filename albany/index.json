Following an interdisciplinary literature review, we recognized three key attributes of words that drive successful interactions: (1) Novelty (2) Familiarity (3) Sentimentality. Based on these attributes, we developed a model to systematically improve a given content using word frequency, sentiment analysis and semantic substitution, and by employing computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We conducted a pilot study (n=416) in which the model was used to formalize evaluation and optimization of academic titles. A between-group design was used to compare responses to the original (control) and modified (treatment) titles. Results show that the modified titles had significantly higher scores for selection, user engagement and memorability. Our findings suggest that users' successful interactions with digital content is fostered by, and perhaps dependent upon, the wording being used. They also provide empirical support that engaging content can be systematically evaluated and produced. Implications and future research directions are discussed.","tags":["sticky"],"title":"Sticky words: Evaluation and optimization of information interactions based on linguistic analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/~nd115232/public/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/~nd115232/public/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Nim Dvir"],"categories":null,"content":"      ","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"4033957889c9963144f6f0de66c4a4bc","permalink":"/~nd115232/public/talk/uxpa/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/~nd115232/public/talk/uxpa/","section":"talk","summary":"Does more information elicit users’ compliance and engagement, or the other way around?

The course was developed for over two years and offered to undergraduate students at universities both in the United States and Israel.  The presentation will include insights resulted from surveys filled by 60 students before, during and after taking the course. They include tips in three major domains (1) Integration of business and technology – The course is built on a multidisciplinary approach which reviews the various aspects of conducting business online, including business strategies, technical infrastructure, design practices and other commercial, social and technical considerations surrounding the analysis and implementation of e-business. (2) Relation to industry - Students are exposed to a variety of industry resources, real-world business examples and a caliber of technology with which they will work in their careers. Guest lectures by leading practitioners also provide real-world context (3) Practical experience - The course deliverables are based on real-life projects, which can be translated later in the job market. They include business analysis of an existing e-business, developing an original business idea in the form of an investors proposal and receiving a Google AdWords certification, a professional accreditation by Google that recognizes individuals as experts in online advertising.","tags":["content strategy","UX"],"title":"Teaching E-commerce to STEM students - Leveraging evidence from a large-scale survey","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objective: Examine the possibility to use computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) for methodological, automatic or semi-automatic evaluation and creation of engaging digital content.\n","date":1524801600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524801600,"objectID":"a32a3de5df5d062b486493e727337bb2","permalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/sticky/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/sticky/","section":"project","summary":"Objective: Examine the possibility to use computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) for methodological, automatic or semi-automatic evaluation and creation of engaging digital content.","tags":["A/B Testing","content strategy","NLP","user studies","research"],"title":"Computational text analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project encompasses empirical examinations of how users willingness\u0026rsquo; to disclose personal data is influenced by the amount of information provided on landing pages – standalone web pages created explicitly for marketing or advertising campaigns. \nA series of large-scale web experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) were conducted employing a between-subjects design and A/B testing.

However, research shows that there are several challenges for open data effectiveness. This paper reviews current determinants and issues associated with the open government data (OGD) procedures. The review concentrates on two ends of the spectrum: First, from the perspective of the preparation by the government, focusing on the organization of traditional governmental datasets and how the recording of the data is administered. Second, from the perspective of the users, focusing on the way in which the data is released to the general public and on human-computer interaction (HCI) issues between end-user and data-consumption interfaces. Following a thorough analysis of these two opposing challenges, the paper proposes approaches to mitigate them. This review and subsequent recommendations contribute and expand current understanding of open government data effectiveness and can lead to public policy changes, development of new procedures and strategies, and ultimately improvements at both ends of the federal open data endeavor.","tags":["content strategy","public policy"],"title":"Mitigating challenges of open government data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ClaimFame  SEO Guidelines  Trackimo (product)  Market Research  ","date":1493265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493265600,"objectID":"f9ddf295d64490bc86f323df7fce5f64","permalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/content/","publishdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/content/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":["UX writing","content strategy","marketing","design"],"title":"Content management","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" TimeOut  Wireframe Content development   Social     ","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"49f6df40f7bfc9cbe57b717937d709fb","permalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/ideation/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/~nd115232/public/project/ideation/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":["ideation","design","content strategy"],"title":"Ideation and design","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
