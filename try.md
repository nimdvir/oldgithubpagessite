It was obvious that a lot of time and effort went into creating the weekly slides and choosing helpful sources for us to read. Professor Dvir is extremely knowledgable and consistently showed that he cared about teaching us. He was kind, understanding, and present in discussions and in the course materials. He always responded promptly to emails and other communication and was very active in the Ask a Question forum. He was the only professor I have had who also contributed to weekly discussions on occasion, which I really enjoyed. He always made sure that we knew if we were on the right track or needed to revisit the course materials, and wanted to see us succeed. Overall, I would highly recommend anyone (majors and non-majors alike) to take this class with Professor Dvir and I would love to take another course with him.
