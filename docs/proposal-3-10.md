1.  Introduction

    1.  Background

Understanding how information is consumed, perceived and used, and why, is a
question of fundamental interest to IS researchers and practitioners. In a
recent editorial of the DATA BASE, Petter, Carter, Randolph and Lee (2018)
‎express concerns about the lack of clear understanding of the core concept of
‎information is defined as the meaning of data, in Information Systems (IS)
research.‎ Specifcally, effectiveness. The challenge becomes how to

This research suggests an innovative framework to conceptually and operationally
define, measure and design effective information. ‎

The question is not in IS research. During the last two decades, the use of ICT
has increased radically . the growing proliferation, use of information and
‎communications technologies ‎‎(ICT) profoundly changing all aspects of social
organization, including the economy, ‎education, health, warfare, and
government..‎ ‎The creation, use and communication of digital information come to
play an increasingly important economic, political, and cultural role with the
growing reliance on ICT. ‎

ICT have become a ‎crucial medium in the online environment for presenting the
‎information and delivering ‎informational services. Websites become part of
strategic ‎organizational tools for ‎generating revenue ranging from the corporate
sector, ‎government ministries to ‎municipal, nonprofit organizational,
semi-structure company ‎and even in small business. ‎ ICT are becoming ‎prominent
way for people to consume information (Horrigan, 2017). ‎Foe example, 93% ‎of
American adults reported consuming information online, either via ‎a mobile
device or ‎a computer (Smith, 2017; Stocking, 2017). 79% of U.S. adults ‎reported
ever making an ‎online purchase, spending nearly \$350 billion annually (Smith,
‎‎2017); 80% of Americans ‎have used at least one online government service (Chan &
‎Pan, 2008; Im, ‎Porumbescu, & Lee, 2013); and 71% of Americans report looking
online ‎for health ‎information (Perski, Blandford, West, & Michie, 2017; Rock
Health, 2015). ‎93% of Americans report of consuming information online, either
via a mobile device or a computer (Stocking, 2017). 80% of Americans have used
at least one online government service

(Im, Porumbescu, & Lee, 2013). 79% of U.S. adults reported ever making an online
purchase, spending nearly \$350 billion annually

(Smith, 2017) . 71% of Americans report looking online for health information

(Rock Health, 2015).

However, as technology advances, new challenges emerge.‎
-------------------------------------------------------

The substantial increase in online information, published by commercial
businesses, ‎‎governments, healthcare organizations, and private citizens, lead to
billions of Web ‎‎pages available (Lucian, 2014).‎ As information becomes
increasingly abundant and immediately available, ‎two undesirable phenomanens:
**Information pollution** ‎refers to the contamination of information supply with
irrelevant, ‎‎redundant, unsolicited , hampering and low-value information. ‎ The
spread of information, often useless and undesirable, can have a ‎detrimental
effect on ‎human activities.‎ this is called **Information overload** is a term
used to describe the difficulty of understanding an issue and effectively making
decisions when one has too much information about that issue.

‎ The flood of information has become a ubiquitous research and business problem,
from reading relevant articles or reports to screening e-mails or browsing the
Internet (Eppler & Mengis, 2004).

Encounters with massive amounts of potentially relevant information limit
cognitive abilities and satisfaction As content has grown increasingly abundant
and immediately available, ‎attention ‎‎becomes the limiting factor in the
consumption of information. ‎

. As more web content becomes available user attention stretches even thinner
across the online space, making it possible only for a small percentage to
receive significant traffic (Arapakis, Cambazoglu, & Lalmas, 2017). From the
information that is noticed, less than a third is read by users -- On the
average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an
average visit (Nielsen, 2008, 2015). Only a small portion of information
receives significant attention, while the remaining majority is barely noticed

(Szabo & Huberman, 2008).

Information overload is associated with a host of undesirable outcomes including
diminished productivity, poor decision making, or simply lack of effectiveness,
as most information consumed using ICT is quickly forgotten (Ackoff, 1989; Chen
et al., 2009; Eppler & Mengis, 2004; Klingberg, 2009).

constructs‎

‎Objectives and approach
-----------------------

the paper proposes approaches to mitigate them.
-----------------------------------------------

I put forward information delivery and user engagement as important research
‎constructs, and argue for their applicability across contexts. ‎

Drawing upon the knowledge-based view of information, we present a revised model
of decision-making based on the interplay between data, information, and
knowledge

Identify three information constructs that help define the problem space and
identify possible solutions.

They are **information interaction** (the task), information experience and
**engagement** (the user) and the **system** (information management and
communication).

### Information interaction (HII)

Information interaction is specifically the “process that people use in
interacting with the content” of a system (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ).

Data are sensory stimuli that we perceive through our senses. Information is
data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient
(Davis and Olson, 1985). Knowledge is what has understood and evaluated by the
knower. Data is the representation of information in a formalized manner, and
hence capable ‎of being communicated or manipulated by ‎some process. Information
is the meaning that a human assigns to data. ‎ ‎ ‎( Holmes, 2001). Data are a
representation of facts or ideas ‎The representation of the Digital content, or
simply “Content”, refers to information stored and accessed via ‎computers.
Digital content may take the form of text (such as electronic documents),
‎multimedia files (such as audio or video files), or any other file type that
follows a ‎content lifecycle requiring management.‎

most work until the early mid-1970s was concerned with system use rather than
user behaviour or “information behaviour”. Since the 1980s there has been a
shift towards a “personcentred” approach, rather than a “system-centred”
approach .

Second, there need to be a focus on the information itself. Early IS literature
points to information, not technology, as the core of the IS discipline ‎‎(Petter
et al., 2018). ‎

Addressing this call, we acknowledge that while the aspects of information in
‎business ‎‎operations and decision-making have been studied for decades, there ‎is
still a gap in ‎‎theorizing the concept in the IS literature.‎

lack of clear understanding of the core concept of in Information Systems (IS)
research, ‎IS researchers often overlook the role of information as a component
of (Petter et al., ‎‎2018).‎ ‎“information effectiveness” refers to a “literal
economy of information and the reference disciplines ‎which deals with
assessments of performance or valuation of information” ‎(Keen, 1980, p. 12).

Information The meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known
conventions used in their representation. [(Zins,
2007)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?FKf40i)

Data are a representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner, and hence
capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process.

Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer
interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user
experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how
data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction
design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e.,
the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff,
1994). Information interaction is specifically the “process that people use in
interacting with the content” of a system (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ).

The essence of the information phenomenon has been characterized as the
occurrence ‎of a communication process that takes place between the sender and
the recipient of ‎the ‎message. Thus, the various concepts of information tend to
concentrate on the ‎origin and the end point of ‎this communication process
(Wersig and Neveling, 1975). ‎

Interaction design focus on interactivity, or behaviour. It connects and
transforms data to knowledge by extracting information from data, and ‎exploiting
the ability of the human mind to assign meaning to information.‎

### Information engagement (IE)

engagement is an expression of that interactivity.

Information experience (IX) - User engagement is a quality of user experience
characterized by the depth of an actor’s investment when interacting with a
digital system (O’Brien, 2016a). **The international standard on ergonomics of
human system interaction, ISO 9241-210,[1] defines user experience as "a
person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use
of a product, system or service".**

Engagement is more than user satisfaction: it is believed that the ability to
engage and sustain engagement in digital environments can result in positive
outcomes for citizen inquiry and participation, e-health, web search,
e-learning, and so on. Yet user engagement (UE) is an abstract construct that
manifests differently within different computer-mediated contexts, and this has
made it challenging to define, design for, and evaluate.

Quality of UX (usability.gov). **Estimate of The level of involvement end-users
have with information interaction.** Focused attention on a particular item of
information.

**Desired, even essential, experience when consuming online information** (Attfield,
Kazai, Lalmas, & Piwowarski, 2011, Laurel, 1993)

**Engagement is considered a desirable—even essential—human response to
computer‐mediated activities (Laurel, 2014).** **Despite the need to engage users
and create engaging technologies, there is no agreed upon definition of the
construct.** .

According to The Advertising Research Foundation (ARF), ‎"The industry is moving
toward customer engagement with marketing communications as the 21st century
metric of marketing efficiency and effectiveness (Plummer et al., 2006)

2016

Influenced by different variables -- system, context, user, design, content
(O’Brien, 2011)

**In recent years, the term user engagement (UE) has been increasingly used to
describe ‎users’ interactions with Information and communication technologies
(ICT). Given the ‎competition for users’ attention and interest, it is agreed
that technologies must ‎engage users to be successful. ‎**

User engagement is a quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an
actor’s investment when interacting with a digital system (O’Brien, 2016a).
Engagement is more than user satisfaction: it is believed that the ability to
engage and sustain engagement in digital environments can result in positive
outcomes for citizen inquiry and participation, e-health, web search,
e-learning, and so on. Yet user engagement (UE) is an abstract construct that
manifests differently within different computer-mediated contexts, and this has
made it challenging to define, design for, and evaluate. User experience, a term
used to describe **all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.**

**As a whole, research emphasizes user-centred approaches to user ‎engagement,
‎highlighting the individual’s cognitive, affective, and behavioural ‎factors of
human-‎computer interactions, and their need for technologies that ‎stimulate each
of these ‎components.‎**

**In recent years, the term user engagement (UE) has been increasingly used to
describe users’ interactions with Information and communication technologies
(ICT) [\@dvir2019]. User engagement.** While information interaction focuses on
the user experience with content, **engagement is an expression of that
interactivity.**

To move the mind of your readers, you’ll need their interest and tacit consent.

**A quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor’s investment
when interacting with a digital system** [\@obrien2016]. Engagement is more than
user satisfaction: it is believed that the ability to engage and sustain
engagement in digital environments can result in positive outcomes for citizen
inquiry and participation, e-health, web search, e-learning, and so on. **Yet
user engagement (UE) is an abstract construct that manifests differently within
different computer-mediated contexts, and this has made it challenging to
define, design for, and evaluate.**

UE is a significant factor in system design and adoption, with theoretical and
empirical evidence of the positive impact of user engagement in education,
government, business and more (Arapakis, Lalmas, Cambazoglu, Marcos, & Jose,
2014; R. Jacques & others, 1995; Oh & Sundar, 2016). It is generally agreed that
given the competition for users’ attention and interest, technologies must
engage users to be successful (H. L. O’Brien, 2016c). Thus, there is a growing
need for a deep understanding of the process of **user engagement and the
factors that influence it** (Lalmas et al., 2014; H. L. O’Brien, 2016c).
**Engaging the user has become a goal – and to some extent, a necessity – in a
variety of information-rich contexts (Lalmas et al., 2014). However, current
research is unstructured and spread across various disciplines, leading ‎to
wide-ranging, and sometimes disparate, perspectives, vocabularies, and
measurement ‎methodologies‎.**

**The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the term *engagement* as a “state of
emotional involvement or commitment” and “process of drawing favorable attention
and interest” (“Engagement,” 2018).**

Both as an end-state and a process, engagement has been considered a desirable
goal in various contexts, such as government, education, marketing, health and
more (Feng & Ots, 2015; Frick, 2010; Lagun & Lalmas, 2016; Lalmas et al., 2014).
For example, in the context of government and public policy, the terms the
“civic engagement” or “political engagement” indicate healthy participation in
the political process (Abbas, 2010; Chan & Pan, 2008; Dvir, 2017;
Grimmelikhuijsen et al., 2013; Gutman, 1982); In education research, “student
engagement” describes desired participation in learning experiences (Appleton et
al., 2008; Bomia et al., 1997; Cole, 2009; Dvir, 2015; Meece et al., 1988); In
business and marketing, “consumer engagement” is used frequently to describe
positive consumer relationships with a company or a brand (Batra & Ray, 1986;
Brodie et al., 2013; Rowley, 2008; Zheng et al., 2015).

Recently, researchers from diverse fields and with a common interest in
technologies began to pay attention to a new type of engagement – that is user
engagement (UE). The term is used to describe users’ level of involvement and
investment in the interaction with Information and communication technologies
(ICT) (Attfield et al., 2011; O’Brien & Toms, 2008). It pertains to the quality
and depth of the user experience (UX) (O’Brien, 2011; O’Brien & Toms, 2008). It
emphasizes the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology and so
being motivated to use it (Attfield et al., 2011; O’Brien & Toms, 2008).

Research on UE is thriving, as the term has been increasingly used in
professional and academic literature. This reflects the centrality of UE to the
formulation of successful interaction with technology.

However, current research is unstructured and spread across various disciplines,
‎leading ‎to wide-ranging, and sometimes disparate, perspectives, vocabularies,
and ‎measurement ‎methodologies‎. ‎

engagement with information at a theoretical and conceptual level is still
limited (Boell, 2017). ‎In Petter et al.’s (2018) words, the IS discipline needs
to be more “deliberate” about its study of ‎information.‎

### Content

Information delivery - Content strategy (CS) - representation

UI design Content

**Digital nudging** is the use of user-interface design elements to guide
people’s behavior in digital choice environments (Weinmann, 2016). Digital
choice environments are user interfaces – such as web-based forms and ERP
screens – that require people to make judgments or decisions. Humans face
choices every day, but **the outcome of any choice is influenced not only by
rational deliberations of the available options but also by the design of the
choice environment in which information is presented, which can exert a
subconscious influence on the outcome. In other words, ‘‘what is chosen often
depends upon how the choice is presented’’ (Johnson et al. 2012, p. 488)**

User interface (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of user
interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile
devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on

**Content management (CM)** is a set of processes and technologies that supports
the collection, managing, and publishing of information in any form or medium.

importance of the sender in the communication processes

**include generation and reception of information in such a way that a state of
knowledge is transformed.**

[\@content2019]

“Content” is the representation.

However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a difficult and
unsolved task. **This is because of the lack of standardised, well-validated
methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context.**

**How to create engaging interactions with digital content, or interactive
content engagement (ICE)**

Part of the efforts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage
‎with web content, ‎

Nim has developed a conceptual model of user engagement with digital content; a
‎methodology for evaluation and creation of engaging content based on reliable
and ‎reusable metrics, and an instrument for automatic optimization of given
content ‎employing ‎

![](media/d14505b55f25ff2aa0fcb94a07b5327e.png)

**The challenge becomes how to conceptually and operationally define, measure ‎and
design ICE engaging content interactions, as importantly. how to operationally
‎measure and design it.‎**

ICE

The objectives of this research are to define engagement conceptually and
operationally in the context of interactive search systems. This research will
deconstruct engagement into a set of attributes that can be defined and
measured. Specifically, it will confirm which attributes constitute engagement,
develop and instrument for assessing engaging interactions, and then evaluate
the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the instrument by examining
humancomputer interactions with applications such as multimedia webcasts
repositories and Web searching.

The purpose of this research is to develop a theoretical framework to root
engagement, defining it both conceptually and practically, and to construct a
reliable, valid, and generalizable model instrument **that measures engagement
outcomes**.

The key research questions are:

**Q1. What characterize ICE?**

What are the distinct stages in engagement? **‎** How can we reliably and validly
measure those attributes? ‎

**Q2. What content features influence ICE?**

**Q3. Can ICE be systematically evaluated and developed?**

To do so, I propose a three-phase research project:

### Phase I — Conceptual definition 

Identify the dimensions of ICE by developing and testing a conceptual model of
engagement.

I support my thesis through an interdisciplinary literature review, in which I
synthesize relevant research streams.

First, I draw on well-established theories relating to **motivational
behaviour** (e.g., self-determination theory and uses and gratifications
theory), **technology adoption and usage** (e.g., the technology acceptance
model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), and the
**subjective user experience** (e.g., flow and play theories).

Second, This section investigates domain research and empirical studies that
have expanded ‎our understanding of the complexity of user engagement and its
role in various ‎contexts: Digital news, e-commerce and marketing, Gaming, Social
media, online ‎information search, Digital Health Technologies, Public policy and
governance and ‎eLearning. ‎

Third, user interviews

**User experience research** focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and
motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback
methodologies (Kuniavsky, 2003). ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION

(Zins, 2007)

The result of these steps is **a conceptual process model of user engagement
with digital content.** In particular, the model explicates three steps
(discovery, perception, and participation), and identifies a set of attributes
of engaging content (i.e., novelty, familiarity, and sentiment polarity).

### Phase II — Instrument development

In this phase, I conduct exploratory (qualitative and quantitative) studies to
refine the content attributes, operationalize the constructs, and **develop a
method for creating engaging content that is precise enough to allow for
quantitative evaluation and operational formulation.**

Quantitative predictions are made from a model for word recognition. The model
has as its central feature a set of "logogens," devices which accept information
relevant to a particular word response irrespective of the source of this
information. When more than a threshold amount of information has accumulated in
any logogen, that particular response becomes available for responding. The
model is tested against data available on (1) the effect of word frequency on
recognition, (2) the effect of limiting the number of response alternatives, (3)
the interaction of stimulus and context, and (4) the interaction of successive
presentations of stimuli. Implications of the underlying model are largely
upheld. Other possible models for word recognition are discussed as are the
implications of the logogen model for theories of memory. (30 ref.) (PsycINFO
Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Based on the method, I develop an instrument for automatic or semi-automatic
evaluation, optimization, and creation of engaging content using NLP techniques,
such as word frequency, sentiment analysis and lexical substitution.

### Phase III — Empirical validation

In this phase (future) I will test the reliability and validity of the
instrument and conceptual model, and assess their generalizability to other
contexts.

In the doctoral consortium I plan to present the results from a pilot study
(*n*=416) in which the model, methodology and instrument were **employed to
formalize evaluation and optimization of ‎engaging ‎content; specifically, titles
and abstracts of academic publications.**

Significance
------------

interactive content engagement requires a theoretical framework that takes into
account multiple attributes that are likely related to users, systems, and tasks
within search contexts. This research will confirm the nature of ICE, how to
measure and design it. The **Interactive Content Engagement** Theory will bridge
interdisciplinary (e.g. information science, computer science, HCI) approaches
to framing search experiences by demonstrating the complex and dynamic
relationships between users’ behaviour, affect, and cognition and the computer
interfaces they use to accomplish their tasks in various search contexts. By
understanding and operationalizing engagement, we can begin to focus efforts on
designing search interfaces that engage users with features appropriate to the
task and context of their interactions. Thus, the contributions of this work are
both theoretical and applied, and will benefit the information science field by
enabling researchers and practitioners alike to understand the dynamic
relationship between users and computer applications and tasks, and how to
assess whether engagement is taking place. Future work will examine how to
design interfaces that engage users.

Literature review
=================

*significant prior research*  
no established theoretical frameworks exist for articulating engagement, but
several theories may be drawn upon to explore and understand it.

For the synthesis, We followed an approach suggested by Webster and Watson
(Webster & Watson, 2002): We first analyzed and compared the various
contributions to research and identified similarities and differences among the
various perspectives. **We then followed an inductive method of generalization
-- the formulation of general concepts from specific instances by abstracting
common properties.**

The existence of multiple conflicting theories regarding information poses
‎challenges to ‎‎IS research. A critical mission for IS research is to design IS to
‎improve business ‎‎operations and decision-making (Arnott & Pervan, 2014; ‎Lederman
& Johnston, 2011)‎

The DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success [\@delone2003]

The information systems success model (alternatively IS success model or Delone

The IS success model identifies and describes the relationships among six
critical dimensions of IS success: information quality, system quality, service
quality, system use/usage intentions, user satisfaction, and net system
benefits.

**Information quality** - refers to the quality of the information that the
system is able to store, deliver, or produce, and is one of the most common
dimensions along which information systems are evaluated. Information quality
impacts both a user’s satisfaction with the system and the user’s intentions to
use the system, which, in turn, impact the extent to which the system is able to
yield benefits for the user and organization.

Information quality was proven to be significant and measured in terms of
accuracy, timeliness, completeness, relevance, and consistency” (DeLone &
McLean, 2003; William H. DeLone & Ephraim R. McLean, 1992)

The quality of information is positively related to decision quality

the reduction of uncertainty or doubt

Wilson's theory of information behaviour was born out of a need to focus on
human use of information, rather than the use of information systems and
sources. Wilson proposed that the term **information behavior** refers to **the
way people search for and utilize information and** covers all aspects of human
information behavior, whether active or passive, in relation to sources and
channels of information (T.D. Wilson, 1997, 2000).

Wilson’s model of information behaviour include the following sub-processes:

‎'Activating mechanisms' - Relevant impetus that prompt a decision to seek
‎information

(Wilson, 1996)

**Information Seeking** behavior is the act of actively seeking information in
order to answer a specific query, i.e. **purposive seeking** of information as a
consequence of a need to satisfy some goal.

**Information Searching behavior** is the behavior which stems from the searcher
interacting with the system in question.

**Information Use** pertains to the searcher adopting the knowledge they sought.

maximizing usability and the user experience. The goal of user interface design
is to ‎make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms
of ‎accomplishing user goals (user-centered design). ‎

Usefulness is the issue of whether the system can be used to achieve some
desired goal. It can again be broken down into the two categories of utility and
usability. Utility is the question of whether the functionality of the system in
principle can do what is needed, and usability is the question of how well users
can use that functionality (Nielsen, 1993).

Wilson's Model is aimed at linking theories to action. However, there have not
been many links made between this research and **changes in policy or practice**
(Tom D. Wilson, 2010) .

UE theory
---------

Since its early days, HCI research focused almost exclusively on the achievement
of behavioural goals. The task became the pivotal point of **user-centred
analysis and evaluation techniques** (e.g. usability testing).

‎●‎

There have been a few attempts to develop models that depict the UE process, its
influences, and its antecedents. Extant UE models focus on engagement as an
interaction process and examine relationships amongst variables with the goal of
predicting or identifying outcomes of UE (O’Brien, 2016).

(Jacques, 1996; Jacques & others, 1995) proposed that engagement consists of six
attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components include
the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task,
perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by
the user, as well as the user’s perception of time (“dragging on” or “flying
by”) and attitude (negative or positive).

Hart et al. (2012) focus on users’ judgement within session. Originating from a
series of experimental studies a three-stage process model of user judgement for
quality was proposed, encompass the nature of interaction as explored through
affect, flow and presence. It focuses on how judgements of quality criteria
(e.g. usability, classic and expressive aesthetics) are determined by the
intersection of the user goal or task, the domain or application type and
product features. According to Hart et al. (2012), the principles of affect
(mood and emotion), flow (immersion) and presence (involvement) are known to
affect human behavior and judgement, yet how these principles influence user
engagement is poorly understood.

O’Brien and Toms (2008) also suggested that UE is not a singular element, but
rather a process, as users move in the same trajectory when interacting with
ICT. The process model is comprised of four distinct stages: point of
engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement. Each of these is
characterized by a set of attributes.

| **Figure 3. The Process model of User engagement (O’Brien & Toms, 2008)**  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [./media/image5.png](./media/image5.png)                                   |
|                                                                            |

This conceptual behavioral model views engagement as a process in which computer
users initiate and sustain engagement, disengage with the application or task,
and potentially re-engage once or several times (O’Brien & Toms, 2008).

**The point of engagement** occurs when the user decides to invest in the
interaction. It is initiated by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the
interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be
achieved through the interaction.

**Period of sustained engagement** happens when users are able to maintain their
attention and interest in the application.

**Disengagement** occurred when participants made an internal decision to stop
the activity, or when factors in the participants' external environment caused
them to cease being engaged.

**Re-engagement** is returning to an application in future was the result of
positive experience with that application.

By segmenting engagement into stages, O’Brien & Toms were able to identify
attributes of UE from previous research that seemed most salient for that phase
of the interaction and therefore predict and facilitate engagement.

**engagement attribute** is a characteristic of the user-computer interaction
that influences or is a component of the engagement. Engagement attributes are
products of users' interactions with the technology, since they depend on what
the user finds innately compelling (O’Brien & Toms, 2008).

O’Brien and Toms (2010) developed an attribute-based approach to UE, which can
be used as a methodological framework for measurement. They produced and
evaluated a multidimensional tool for evaluating engaging outcomes with a
technology called the User Engagement Scale (UES). The UES taps into six
dimensions of experience: Novelty and aesthetics reflect users’ attraction to
the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture
cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system
use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend
the website to others.

| **Figure 4. The User engagement scale (UES) (O’Brien et al., 2018)** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [./media/image6.png](./media/image6.png)                             |

Recently, the UES was refined to a new short form. Although the original six
factors had some explanatory power, a revised model was recently offered, where
the items did not change, but how they were grouped based on modified dimensions
as subscales were altered. The of the UES are an aesthetic appeal, focused
attention, perceived usability, and endurability (O’Brien et al., 2018).

The table below lists the various attributes of the UES and the definitions:

**Table 4. Attributes of UES and their definitions**

The frameworks proposed of the UE Process Model and the UES have been tested for
reliability, validity, and generalizability in various domains, mostly leisure
(online news, shopping, digital games, social media) (O’Brien, 2011). The
studies corroborate the UE process model and the feasibility of a universal
measure of UE (O’Brien et al., 2016, 2017, 2018; O’Brien & Cairns, 2016; O’Brien
& Toms, 2008, 2010). The studies also demonstrated that engagement is consistent
across diverse types of applications in terms of the trajectory followed by
users through the process and the attributes present. The UES has been adopted
by more than 50 international research teams who have used it to examine UE with
educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and
consumer applications, and other media (O’Brien et al., 2018; O’Brien & Cairns,
2016).

### THE USER ENGAGEMENT SCALE (UES)

Attribute-based approach for evaluating engaging outcomes with a technology.
Taps into six dimensions of experience:

| Novelty & Aesthetic appeal                                                     | Focused attention & Felt involvement | Perceived usability ‎ | Endurability & Reward |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Users’ level of interest and curiosity evoked by the ‎system and its contents. ‎ |                                      |                      |                       |

Novelty and aesthetics reflect users’ attraction to the media system or
interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and
emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents
evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to
others.

The UE process model does not emphasize content; Rather, it focused primarily on
the characteristics of the system and how these were perceived and acted upon by
users.

O’Brien et al. ( 2016) suggested that the user engagement framework be broadened
to incorporate content

Cumulative prospect theory
--------------------------

Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is a model for descriptive decisions under risk
and uncertainty which was introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1992).

The main observation of CPT (and its predecessor Prospect Theory) is that people
tend to think of possible outcomes usually relative to a certain reference point
(often the status quo) rather than to the final status, a phenomenon which is
called **framing effect.**

Prospect theory distinguishes two phases in the choice process: framing and
valuation. In the ‎framing phase, the decision maker constructs **a
representation** of the acts, contingencies, and ‎outcomes that are relevant to
the decision. In the valuation phase, the decision maker assesses the ‎value of
each prospect and chooses accordingly.

**Cognitive biases -** Unconscious, automatic influences on human ‎judgment and
decision making that ‎reliably produce reasoning ‎errors.‎

**Heuristics -** Simple, efficient rules which people often use to form
judgments and make decisions. They are mental shortcuts that usually involve
focusing on one aspect of a complex problem and ignoring others.

Although no formal theory of framing is available, ‎we have learned a fair amount
about the rules that govern  
the representation of acts, outcomes, and contingencies ‎(Tversky & Kahneman,
1992)

Conclusion
==========

User engagement requires a theoretical framework that takes into account
multiple attributes that are likely related to users, systems, and tasks within
search contexts. This research will confirm the nature of engagement and
measuring engagement with search interfaces. The Conceptual Model of User
Engagement will bridge interdisciplinary (e.g. information science, computer
science, HCI) approaches to framing search experiences by demonstrating the
complex and dynamic relationships between users’ behaviour, affect, and
cognition and the computer interfaces they use to accomplish their tasks in
various search contexts. By understanding and operationalizing engagement, we
can begin to focus efforts on designing search interfaces that engage users with
features appropriate to the task and context of their interactions. Thus, the
contributions of this work are both theoretical and applied, and will benefit
the information science field by enabling researchers and practitioners alike to
understand the dynamic relationship between users and computer applications and
tasks, and how to assess whether engagement is taking place. Future work will
examine how to design interfaces that engage users.

**Information pollution**

the contamination of information supply with irrelevant, redundant, unsolicited
, hampering and low-value information. The spread of useless and undesirable
information can have a detrimental effect on human activities.

**User experience (UX)**

momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while ‎interacting with a

1.  Introduction

2.  Literture review

    1.  I draw on well-established theories relating to **motivational
        behavior** (e.g., self-determination theory and uses and gratifications
        theory), **technology adoption and usage** (e.g., the technology
        acceptance model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of
        technology), and the **subjective user experience** (e.g., flow and play
        theories).
