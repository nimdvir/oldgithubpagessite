Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]."

We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300 600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"To avoid any adverse eects because of language-specic bias, we evaluated their English language uency during the tutorial" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \crime and law", \entertainment and lifestyle", \science") and article interestingness (two levels: \interesting", \uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data. Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p &amp;lt; :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p &amp;lt; :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"Table 1: The features used in the clustering analysis and Pearson's correlations to the predicted class of news article interestingness" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"*Correlation is signicant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed)" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"We use the most powerful frequency (with respect to velocity and acceleration) of each mouse gesture as a feature." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1445)&#xD;&#xD;"DISCUSSION &amp;amp; CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented a generalisable solution to measuring within-content engagement using mouse tracking data. Our work is motivated by the fact that millions of users interact daily with online content without providing any explicit feedback about the quality of their experience. Therefore, any eort towards developing a more nuanced" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"6 Evaluates the worth of an attribute by using a userspecied classier." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more in uential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;</style><style face="bold">Extracted Annotations (10/29/2017, 10:40:38 PM)</style><style face="normal">&#xD;&#xD;"The availability of large volumes of interaction data and scalable data mining techniques have made possible to study the online behaviour for millions of Web users.

Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20].

This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations." (Arapakis et al 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (Arapakis et al 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (Arapakis et al 2014:1445)&#xD;&#xD;"DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented a generalisable solution to measuring within-content engagement using mouse tracking data.

Therefore, any eort towards developing a more nuanced" (Arapakis et al 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"6 Evaluates the worth of an attribute by using a userspecied classier." (Arapakis et al 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences." (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more in uential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Our prediction experiments also revealed that it is possible to measure content interestingness by accounting for the frequency of the cursor patterns changes and, subsequently, predict user engagement over time. Our best performing model, using the stacked generalization method with classiers 1NN and SMO, attained the accuracy of 75%, which is considerably better than the baseline. These results are further supported by the statistical analysis we performed on the frequency distribution of mouse gestures, which indi" (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"cated a signicant dierence between interesting and uninteresting news articles. Overall, this suggests an interaction eect between web content interestingness and cursor behaviour. Unlike prior research eorts that have analysed mouse tracking data, our approach does not involve manual or costly attempts (e.g., eye tracking). Also, the proposed method was designed to be as independent as possible from the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position, making it applicable to broader and more heterogeneous contexts. Finally, our work comes with certain limitations. One of them is the relatively small sample of the population we studied. To some extent, this has aected our ability to generalise our ndings to the population as a whole. However, this is a very common caveat in user studies and, in our case, a necessary trade-o, given the controlled and timedemanding nature of our experiment. Also, there is room for improvement, both with respect to the accuracy of the classiers and the feature selection. Our modelling approach can benet from experimenting with additional machine learning techniques, and a more thorough evaluation of our feature set, to improve its discriminative power" (Arapakis et al 2014:1448)&#xD;&#xD;"FUTURE WORK We plan to develop a larger collection of mouse tracking data. One challenge would be to develop sucient ground truth under real-life conditions and at large scale, with the help of other testing methods like bucket testing and query log analysis. Comparing the mouse gestures identied by the proposed method against this kind of ground truth will let us validate whether they have the required physical characteristics and are well-founded, and further ensure that our approach is grounded in more than intuitive plausibility. Finally, we will investigate the sequential nature of mouse gestures using stochastic models that can describe the process of how the data is being generated and account for the transitions between the mouse gestures."

Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content.

In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention.

The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings.

A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313).

These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders.

This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences.

Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"cated a signicant dierence between interesting and uninteresting news articles. Overall, this suggests an interaction eect between web content interestingness and cursor behaviour. Unlike prior research eorts that have analysed mouse tracking data, our approach does not involve manual or costly attempts (e.g., eye tracking). Also, the proposed method was designed to be as independent as possible from the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position, making it applicable to broader and more heterogeneous contexts. Finally, our work comes with certain limitations. One of them is the relatively small sample of the population we studied. To some extent, this has aected our ability to generalise our ndings to the population as a whole. However, this is a very common caveat in user studies and, in our case, a necessary trade-o, given the controlled and timedemanding nature of our experiment. Also, there is room for improvement, both with respect to the accuracy of the classiers and the feature selection. Our modelling approach can benet from experimenting with additional machine learning techniques, and a more thorough evaluation of our feature set, to improve its discriminative power" (Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1448)&#xD;&#xD;"FUTURE WORK We plan to develop a larger collection of mouse tracking data. One challenge would be to develop sucient ground truth under real-life conditions and at large scale, with the help of other testing methods like bucket testing and query log analysis. Comparing the mouse gestures identied by the proposed method against this kind of ground truth will let us validate whether they have the required physical characteristics and are well-founded, and further ensure that our approach is grounded in more than intuitive plausibility. Finally, we will investigate the sequential nature of mouse gestures using stochastic models that can describe the process of how the data is being generated and account for the transitions between the mouse gestures."

We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures.

Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (Arapakis et al 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little  exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300  600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task.

(Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p &lt; :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p &lt; :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

Part of the eorts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage with web content." (Arapakis et al 2014:1439)&#xD;&#xD;"However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a dicult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, wellvalidated methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approach and use a large set of features engineered from our data to extract the cursor patterns. Our ndings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced aect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences" (Arapakis et al 2014:1439)&#xD;&#xD;"Our work is motivated by the fact that millions of users interact with online content without providing any explicit feedback about the quality of their experience. Therefore, deducing in an online, implicit and scalable manner how they feel is considered a high-value task. Given this, our main objective is to understand how cursor behaviour can inform us about well known user engagement measures [29], such as aect, attention, and interest." (Arapakis et al 2014:1439)&#xD;&#xD;"In particular, we consider cursor behaviour irrespective of the page layout, the elements it contains, or their relative position. Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (Arapakis et al 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"Overall, this paper makes the following contributions:  We propose a scalable and non-invasive methodology for measuring within-content engagement, based on mouse gestures, that is applicable to dierent contexts.  We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach.  We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics.  As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (Arapakis et al 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. In section 3 we thoroughly describe our experimental design, followed by Section 4 where we present our analysis and main ndings, which we integrate in a real application scenario, given in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss our ndings and their implications, followed by Section 7 which lays the ground for future work" (Arapakis et al 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (Arapakis et al 2014:1440)&#xD;&#xD;"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little &#xD;exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300  600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"To avoid any adverse eects because of language-specic bias, we evaluated their English language &#xD;uency during the tutorial" (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \crime and law", \entertainment and lifestyle", \science") and article interestingness (two levels: \interesting", \uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data. Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in&#xD;uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (Arapakis et al 2014:1441)&#xD;&#xD;"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p &lt; :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p &lt; :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (Arapakis et al 2014:1442)&#xD;&#xD;"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results." (Arapakis et al 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"Table 1: The features used in the clustering analysis and Pearson's correlations to the predicted class of news article interestingness" (Arapakis et al 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"*Correlation is signicant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed)" (Arapakis et al 2014:1443)&#xD;&#xD;"We use the most powerful frequency (with respect to velocity and acceleration) of each mouse gesture as a feature." (Arapakis et al 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations." (Arapakis et al 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (Arapakis et al 2014:1444)&#xD;&#xD;"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (Arapakis et al 2014:1445)&#xD;&#xD;"DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented a generalisable solution to measuring within-content engagement using mouse tracking data. Our work is motivated by the fact that millions of users interact daily with online content without providing any explicit feedback about the quality of their experience. Therefore, any eort towards developing a more nuanced" (Arapakis et al 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"6 Evaluates the worth of an attribute by using a userspecied classier." (Arapakis et al 2014:1446)&#xD;&#xD;"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences." (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more in&#xD;uential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (Arapakis et al 2014:1447)&#xD;&#xD;"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns.

Using two content sharing portals, Youtube and Digg, we show that by modeling the accrual of views and votes on content offered by these services we can predict the long-term dynamics of individual submissions from initial data. In the case of Digg, measuring access to given stories during the first two hours allows us to forecast their popularity 30 days ahead with remarkable accuracy, while downloads of Youtube videos need to be followed for 10 days to attain the same performance. The differing time scales of the predictions are shown to be due to differences in how content is consumed on the two portals: Digg stories quickly become outdated, while Youtube videos are still found long after they are initially submitted to the portal. We show that predictions are more accurate for submissions for which attention decays quickly, whereas predictions for evergreen content will be prone to larger errors.</abstract><research-notes><style face="bold">Extracted Annotations (10/26/2017, 9:21:39 PM)</style><style face="normal">&#xD;&#xD;"We present a method for accurately predicting the long time popularity of online content from early measurements of user's access."

The purpose of this book is not to constrain UE to one perspective, but to offer a well-rounded appreciation for UE across various domains and disciplines. The text begins with two foundational chapters that describe theoretical and methodological approaches to user engagement; the remaining contributions examine UE from different disciplinary perspectives and across a range of computer-mediated environments, including social and communications media, online search, eLearning, games, and eHealth. The book concludes by bringing together the cross-disciplinary perspectives presented in each chapter and proposing an agenda for future research in this area.&#xD;&#xD;The book will appeal to established and emerging academic and industry researchers looking to pursue research and its challenges. This includes scholars at all levels with an interest in user engagement with digital media, from students to experienced researchers, and professionals in the fields of computer science, web technology, information science, museum studies, learning and health sciences, human-computer interaction, information architecture and design, and creative arts.</abstract><research-notes><style face="bold">Extracted Annotations (10/30/2017, 6:40:55 PM)</style><style face="normal">&#xD;&#xD;"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14)&#xD;&#xD;"As the chapters in this book demonstrate, user engagement has been investigated by researchers in a variety of disciplines, each with their own unique lens. As UE scholars and professionals, we approach our work with particular ideologies and perspectives that have been shaped and honed through years of education and professional experience. Our theoretical stance informs how we propose to define, model, and measure UE. For example, let us imagine that we are interested in UE in eLearning." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement, as with other aspects of subjective user experience, is a complex phenomenon. Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome. Furthermore, all user-system interactions are situated in broader individual, organizational, and social contexts that both facilitate and constrain engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:15)&#xD;&#xD;"We analyse and compare approaches and findings to lend insight into our own research questions and dilemmas while simultaneously working to identify research priorities, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:15)&#xD;&#xD;"engagement with instructional content is "a necessary precondition to learning" and this position is anchored in theory and application; case studies derived from an experiment and a massive open online course (MOOC) are used to reinforce the theoretically derived characteristics of engaging eLearning environments within these unique settings that vary in scale" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:16)&#xD;&#xD;"He fleshes out the temporal aspects of game play from the point of engagement, through sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement and the attributes that characterize these stages" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:16)&#xD;&#xD;"In the chapter "User Engagement with Digital Health Technologies", Kostkova crafts her chapter on eHealth around four main areas of interest: knowledge or attitude change, impact at the point of care, integrative digital storytelling, and professional communities of practice (CoP). Each of these ideas is explored and illustrated with concrete examples of eHealth technologies designed and adapted to meet the needs of a specific group of health consumers or practitioners." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:17)&#xD;&#xD;"The author underscores the need to articulate the purpose of an eHealth technology before determining what mode of delivery and design is most appropriate for engaging the user. She also raises the conundrum that while it is fine to design "engaging" eHealth portals and environments, engagement cannot occur without, first, the awareness that they exist and, second, the ability to access them physically and intellectually." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:17)&#xD;&#xD;"For example, behavioural signals are reliable when they are linked to cognitive and affective signals, yet on their own may be highly interpretive. Relatedly, measures that are not subjected to rigorous evaluation affect the quality of the conclusions that we can draw from the research." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:17)&#xD;&#xD;"Physical interactions with media facilitate cognitive and emotional involvement, which leads to content absorption, culminating in behavioural outcomes which the authors term "outreach"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:17)&#xD;&#xD;"As such, they emphasize that user engagement has cognitive, affective, and behavioural" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:17)&#xD;&#xD;"Preface xvii components and that media—its content and interactive affordances—can affect people's experiences." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:18)&#xD;&#xD;""By examining both tangible indicators of engagement, such as usage and activity counts, as well as more abstract indicators relating to positive user experiences, we can begin to understand why people engage at the level they do, with what kinds of social media platforms, and to what effect"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:18)&#xD;&#xD;"The book concludes by bridging the cross-disciplinary perspectives presented in each chapter and proposing an agenda for future research in this area" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:18)&#xD;&#xD;"This agenda focuses specifically on building robust theoretical and measurement models of UE, ensuring that research informs design and that application informs research, and raising awareness of the larger ethical and societal issues within which our work is situated. It is our sincere hope that this book will appeal to established and emerging academic and industry researchers who will take up and pursue these various research challenges." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:18)&#xD;&#xD;"Over the past 30 years, and particularly the past decade, user engagement (UE) has become a buzzword in a variety of domain and application areas, including search engines, online gaming platforms, museum portals, and mobile health apps" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:25)&#xD;&#xD;"given the attention the concept is receiving within academia and industry, that UE is a vital part of users' interactions with technology" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:25)&#xD;&#xD;"how we operationalize, measure, and design for human-computer experiences." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:25)&#xD;&#xD;"it examines two theoretical approaches," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:25)&#xD;&#xD;"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Theory and John Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, that have informed much work in the area of UE and describes published behavioural and measurement models that depict the engagement process, its influences, and its antecedents" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:25)&#xD;&#xD;"category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:27)&#xD;&#xD;""a quality of user experience with technology" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:27)&#xD;&#xD;"characterized by the perceived usability and aesthetic appeal of the system, focused attention, novelty, felt involvement, and endurability [38, p. 131] and [44, p. 64" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:27)&#xD;&#xD;"However, there are some ambiguities when we look critically at definitions of UE. For example, Brandtzaeg et al. [8] suggested the major component of engagement is control, whereas Webster and Ahuja [65] labelled engagement "Flow without user control" [emphasis added]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:27)&#xD;&#xD;"we might speculate further on how users' evaluations of content (credibility, relevance, informativeness) contribute to UE; there is already rich scholarship in the disciplines of information scienc" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:28)&#xD;&#xD;"I found that online news readers reported two distinct engagement paths: one group of participants emphasized the novelty and interestingness of news items, whereby" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:28)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement describes their [users'] intrinsically motivated attraction [to a system] and is expressed in cognitive, behavioural and affective terms" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29)&#xD;&#xD;"Existing definitions of UE are typically not limited to one type of technology (with the exception of [29]), but focus instead on the qualities of systems more broadly (e.g. aesthetic appeal) and how the system—and users' interactions with it—affects users' internal states (e.g. motivation, interest, attention). However, the temporal and contextual scope of UE is problematic, and we do not adequately distinguish it from other qualities of interactive experiences." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to play, current definitions also do not distinguish UE from fun, cognitive absorption, or interest. In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30)&#xD;&#xD;"Hassenzahl [25] defined UX as "momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while interacting with a product or service"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42]. Whether we look at usability as part of the engagement equation or UE as one aspect of usability determines the kinds of outcomes we expect from users' interactions with technology and our methodological and design approaches." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"Jacques [27] proposed the following attributes of engagement with educational multimedia systems: attention, motivation, perceived time, control, needs (experiential and utilitarian), and attitudes (feelings). I expanded this list to include ten different attributes of UE (aesthetic appeal, attention, challenge, endurability, feedback, interactivity, control, pleasure, sensory appeal, and variety/novelty) and looked at these in the narratives of gamers, searchers, online shoppers, and eLearners. I found that most—if not all—of these attributes manifested in users' engagement with these applications. In later work, I developed a self-report measure, the user engagement scale (UES), and reduced the number of attributes through factor" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"analysis to perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, novelty, felt involvement, focused attention, and endurability [38, 42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"Jacques's work [27] heavily influenced my research, and there is much overlap in our approach to studying UE. For example, we both emphasized similar attributes, such as attention and motivation, though we looked at motivation from different perspectives" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"Jacques felt that intrinsic motivation was essential for UE within learning environments, whereas I explored utilitarian and hedonic motivations in my work with online shoppers" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"Thus, the nature of UE's defining features—what they are and how they are manifested during engaging experiences—appears to be context and user dependent; this translates into the need for a fluid definition of UE. Constructing a flexible definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking. Less emphasis has been placed on accompanying features of UE, though there are some exceptions. Hyder devised and tested an elaborate model of engagement antecedents (e.g. aesthetics, product involvement, depth of navigation, etc.) and consequences (e.g. intention to purchase, perceived value, brand recall, etc.) in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20 hypotheses, leading to the findings that aesthetics predicted website engagement, which consisted of positive affect, focused attention, challenge, curiosity, and involvement. Website engagement predicted consumers' perceptions of value, intention to purchase, the desire not to switch to competitors, as well as increased brand loyalty. Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"In terms of what theoretical orientations have been used in UE research, Csikszentmihalyi's Theory of Optimal Experience or Flow Theory [15] is commonly cited" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Other theoretical frameworks have included Aesthetic Theory [5], Interaction [56], Play Theory [59, 69], and Social Presence Theory [51]. In my own work [38, 42], I adopted McCarthy and Wright's Threads of Experience [33], which is rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]. In this section, I elaborate on two theoretical streams: Positive Psychology, specifically Flow Theory, and Dewey's Theory of Experience, with examples on how these theories have been applied in UE research." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;""Flow" is a state "in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Positive psychology is finding new ground in HCI with the emergence of "positive computing" [11] and its emphasis on technology for human well-being. However, Flow Theory has been employed within HCI for some time. It has been used to explore users' reactions to and motivations to use various computermediated tools and interfaces [21, 30], to understand the role of situational and personality variables in users' interactions with computers [49], and to help designers build systems or measures to encourage or capture the Flow state [20]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"While most of UE work has emphasized positive emotions, there needs to be more exploration and emphasis on the role of negative affect in UE and how this is a distinction between Flow and UE. In my work in the online news domain [40], I noted that some news readers were drawn into news items that were serious, controversial, sensational, and, frankly, grizzly;" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"performed a sentiment analysis of over 13,000 news articles and then created a corpus of 18 articles that varied in interestingness (high vs. low) and polarity (positive vs. negative). In a subsequent user study that employed eye tracking and self-report measures, the researchers found that interesting news content increased positive affect and led to more focused attention and longer fixations on new and popular news item comments" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"Results also indicated that affect," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"12 H. O'Brien interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity heightened when news content increased in sentiment but became more negative. Thus both the cognitive (interestingness) and affective (polarity) elements of content informed users' perceptions of the news reading experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Peters et al. [48] relay that interest is an affective state that is tightly coupled with attention:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;""attention is deemed to be required for varying degrees of affective processing while, conversely, emotional stimuli capture, maintain and may modulate attention" (Sect. 2.3, para 1)" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"McCay-Peet et al. [34] demonstrated this in their study of visual saliency with online news content. They found that interest in content and wanting to find out more about news items based on headlines helped predict self-reported focused attention." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Thinking about the role of interest in particular and negative emotion more broadly, there is reason to pursue how negative affect predicts and sustains engagement—and this relates to the aforementioned point about mandatory system use. As researchers and designers, we may need people to engage with things that induce discomfortable or negative emotions. This line of thinking is linked with the emerging area of "uncomfortable HCI". For instance" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Halbert and Nathan [22] explored the link between negative emotions and critical reflection for the purposes of facilitating transformative experiences around decolonizing pedagogies in the context of an online graduate course. Their work pushes back on the notion that UE should always be positive and provides a more nuanced view of UE: if UE is intended to result in learning, health behavioural change, political involvement, personal growth, etc., then we must anticipate that UE is more complicated emotionally, cognitively, and behaviourally." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:38)&#xD;&#xD;"While engagement research has already learned much from Dewey, though perhaps not articulated as such, there are two areas that have not been sufficiently explored. First, Dewey emphasizes "purpose," yet little is known about the influence of goals and tasks on user engagement. Second, Dewey stressed accumulated experience but also the role of the social enterprise; more efforts could be invested to specifically examine the role of social practices and context on user engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"Case 1: Flow, Cognitive Load, and Engagement in Adaptive Video Games Sharek [57] used Flow Theory, cognitive load theory (CLT), and engagement to test static, user-controlled, and adaptive gameplay approaches in a series of three experiments." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"grounding to situate his multi-theoretical framework. Sharek examined Flow attributes, namely, clear goals, the immediacy and quality of feedback, the balance between player skill and task challenges, control, focused concentration, loss of self-awareness and external awareness, and time distortion (p. 15). He used Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Model, which proposed that Flow increases linearly as skill and challenge increase; "" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;": :in a learning context, just being in the Flow may not be enough to push a person into situations where their full potential may be realized. This is where Flow Theory and engagement part ways. In the context of learning and serious games, being engaged requires a person to not only be in the Flow state but also to actively seek out more difficult challenges rather than simply balance their skill with the challenges of the task (p. 92)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:40)&#xD;&#xD;"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42)&#xD;&#xD;"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"I have continued to look at the validity of the Process Model of User Engagement with different applications, such as online news browsing [40]. The Process Model of UE has shown good generalizability, but I have articulated the need to incorporate task and content variables into the model [40, 41]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"In this chapter, I have reviewed the varied definitions, theoretical orientations, and models that have been used to frame or emanated from UE research" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"different domain-specific approaches and research questions" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"based upon the studies reviewed in this chapter, with a series of unifying propositions:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement is a process and product of people's interactions with computermediated environments. In other words, UE can be analysed during and after human-computer interactions and at the micro and macro levels. Variables of interest and methodological" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement is a process and product of people's interactions with computermediated environments. In other words, UE can be analysed during and after human-computer interactions and at the micro and macro levels. Variables of interest and methodological approaches and measures should be selected with this in mind" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE. Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. • User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". • User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. • User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. • Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain. We should make an effort to isolate and measure aspects of the context to better understand influences on UE."

That is, our engineering student's willingness to engage in a learning activity at some point in the future is heavily influenced by both her current psychological state and her prior experience in similar activities" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"By extension, her perception of a current task or challenge will be shaped by what she believes the outcome will be which, in turn, is shaped by her past experience in similar situations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"Such models provide a structured way of looking at cognition in a task-oriented environment, assessing cognitive aspects of task demand and resources required to meet cognitive processing needs" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"At the heart of information processing models is the notion of resource allocation. That is, the human cognitive system functions in a constant stream of information from both the natural and human-built world" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level. To do so requires attention to, and engagement with, these information streams. Executive functions in the cognitive system make decisions as to what to attend to and, therefore, what (limited) cognitive resources should be directed to these information streams for further processing" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"A relevant framework built from this general model is Cognitive Load Theory [52, 75]. This theory is predicated on the basic information processing model of limited working memory and (effectively) unlimited long-term memory. This theory was developed specifically to better understand both how students learn and what learning environments are best suited for which kinds of learning tasks. Allied theories developed from the same general information processing model have come to similar conclusions concerning underlying cognitive mechanisms and outcomes [45]. These models work under the assumption that a primary goal is schema formation and the activation and modification of existing schemas for learning [73]."

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130)&#xD;&#xD;"Interactivity stimulates user arousal and emotion, thereby intensifying user experience [25]."

This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5]. Interaction, unexpected events and unusual and unpleasant stimuli all tend to increase arousal, and high arousal increases the strength of emotional experience."

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter focus on retrieval of textual information objects, although a few studies focusing on other types of objects are included when appropriate" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies also focus on retrieval in the context of Internet-based systems and" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"We first review conceptualizations and definitions of engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Our examination of the literature also shows that the term engagement is increasingly being used to describe observed patterns and sets of search behaviors," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32]. This" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:183)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185)&#xD;&#xD;"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:186)&#xD;&#xD;"This is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of flow, where interest in one's task was found to be central to experiences of flow [12]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Poddar and Ruthven [37] found that participants had greater positive emotions and made more use of various search strategies when completing their own search tasks versus assigned search tasks, so the source of the task can impact user experience and effort expended." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190)&#xD;&#xD;"They also found that interest in the article and enjoyment experienced from reading it were higher when the topic of the article had a strong sentiment and negative connotations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Linking content focus and attention, Rokhlenko et al.

[39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

In" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:201)&#xD;&#xD;"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website—customization, multimodality, and contingency. Customization refers to the ability to control users' own communication setting based on their preference" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"With the rise of social media, user engagement can be equated to social media engagement, which is described in more detail in McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase's chapter in this book.

A number of measures have been suggested to capture this voluntary sharing behavior, including the number of comments and reviews on a company blog, the amount of consumer-generated media (CGM), and the frequency of forwarding the content to so" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"There are relatively few studies that propose a definition of user engagement with all of the three factors summarized above—(a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model—collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality.

Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change.

Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome.

In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30)&#xD;&#xD;"Hassenzahl [25] defined UX as "momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while interacting with a product or service"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42].

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking. Less emphasis has been placed on accompanying features of UE, though there are some exceptions. Hyder devised and tested an elaborate model of engagement antecedents (e.g. aesthetics, product involvement, depth of navigation, etc.) and consequences (e.g. intention to purchase, perceived value, brand recall, etc.) in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20 hypotheses, leading to the findings that aesthetics predicted website engagement, which consisted of positive affect, focused attention, challenge, curiosity, and involvement. Website engagement predicted consumers' perceptions of value, intention to purchase, the desire not to switch to competitors, as well as increased brand loyalty. Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"In terms of what theoretical orientations have been used in UE research, Csikszentmihalyi's Theory of Optimal Experience or Flow Theory [15] is commonly cited" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Other theoretical frameworks have included Aesthetic Theory [5], Interaction [56], Play Theory [59, 69], and Social Presence Theory [51]. In my own work [38, 42], I adopted McCarthy and Wright's Threads of Experience [33], which is rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]. In this section, I elaborate on two theoretical streams: Positive Psychology, specifically Flow Theory, and Dewey's Theory of Experience, with examples on how these theories have been applied in UE research." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;""Flow" is a state "in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Positive psychology is finding new ground in HCI with the emergence of "positive computing" [11] and its emphasis on technology for human well-being. However, Flow Theory has been employed within HCI for some time. It has been used to explore users' reactions to and motivations to use various computermediated tools and interfaces [21, 30], to understand the role of situational and personality variables in users' interactions with computers [49], and to help designers build systems or measures to encourage or capture the Flow state [20]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"While most of UE work has emphasized positive emotions, there needs to be more exploration and emphasis on the role of negative affect in UE and how this is a distinction between Flow and UE. In my work in the online news domain [40], I noted that some news readers were drawn into news items that were serious, controversial, sensational, and, frankly, grizzly;" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"performed a sentiment analysis of over 13,000 news articles and then created a corpus of 18 articles that varied in interestingness (high vs. low) and polarity (positive vs. negative). In a subsequent user study that employed eye tracking and self-report measures, the researchers found that interesting news content increased positive affect and led to more focused attention and longer fixations on new and popular news item comments" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"Results also indicated that affect," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"12 H. O'Brien interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity heightened when news content increased in sentiment but became more negative. Thus both the cognitive (interestingness) and affective (polarity) elements of content informed users' perceptions of the news reading experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Peters et al. [48] relay that interest is an affective state that is tightly coupled with attention:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;""attention is deemed to be required for varying degrees of affective processing while, conversely, emotional stimuli capture, maintain and may modulate attention" (Sect. 2.3, para 1)" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"McCay-Peet et al. [34] demonstrated this in their study of visual saliency with online news content. They found that interest in content and wanting to find out more about news items based on headlines helped predict self-reported focused attention." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Thinking about the role of interest in particular and negative emotion more broadly, there is reason to pursue how negative affect predicts and sustains engagement—and this relates to the aforementioned point about mandatory system use. As researchers and designers, we may need people to engage with things that induce discomfortable or negative emotions. This line of thinking is linked with the emerging area of "uncomfortable HCI". For instance" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Halbert and Nathan [22] explored the link between negative emotions and critical reflection for the purposes of facilitating transformative experiences around decolonizing pedagogies in the context of an online graduate course. Their work pushes back on the notion that UE should always be positive and provides a more nuanced view of UE: if UE is intended to result in learning, health behavioural change, political involvement, personal growth, etc., then we must anticipate that UE is more complicated emotionally, cognitively, and behaviourally." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:38)&#xD;&#xD;"While engagement research has already learned much from Dewey, though perhaps not articulated as such, there are two areas that have not been sufficiently explored. First, Dewey emphasizes "purpose," yet little is known about the influence of goals and tasks on user engagement. Second, Dewey stressed accumulated experience but also the role of the social enterprise; more efforts could be invested to specifically examine the role of social practices and context on user engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"Case 1: Flow, Cognitive Load, and Engagement in Adaptive Video Games Sharek [57] used Flow Theory, cognitive load theory (CLT), and engagement to test static, user-controlled, and adaptive gameplay approaches in a series of three experiments."

Sharek examined Flow attributes, namely, clear goals, the immediacy and quality of feedback, the balance between player skill and task challenges, control, focused concentration, loss of self-awareness and external awareness, and time distortion (p. 15). He used Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Model, which proposed that Flow increases linearly as skill and challenge increase; "" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;": :in a learning context, just being in the Flow may not be enough to push a person into situations where their full potential may be realized. This is where Flow Theory and engagement part ways. In the context of learning and serious games, being engaged requires a person to not only be in the Flow state but also to actively seek out more difficult challenges rather than simply balance their skill with the challenges of the task (p. 92)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:40)&#xD;&#xD;"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42)&#xD;&#xD;"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"I have continued to look at the validity of the Process Model of User Engagement with different applications, such as online news browsing [40].

Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. • User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". • User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. • User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. • Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

That is, our engineering student's willingness to engage in a learning activity at some point in the future is heavily influenced by both her current psychological state and her prior experience in similar activities" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"By extension, her perception of a current task or challenge will be shaped by what she believes the outcome will be which, in turn, is shaped by her past experience in similar situations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"Such models provide a structured way of looking at cognition in a task-oriented environment, assessing cognitive aspects of task demand and resources required to meet cognitive processing needs" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"At the heart of information processing models is the notion of resource allocation. That is, the human cognitive system functions in a constant stream of information from both the natural and human-built world" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level. To do so requires attention to, and engagement with, these information streams. Executive functions in the cognitive system make decisions as to what to attend to and, therefore, what (limited) cognitive resources should be directed to these information streams for further processing" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"A relevant framework built from this general model is Cognitive Load Theory [52, 75]. This theory is predicated on the basic information processing model of limited working memory and (effectively) unlimited long-term memory. This theory was developed specifically to better understand both how students learn and what learning environments are best suited for which kinds of learning tasks. Allied theories developed from the same general information processing model have come to similar conclusions concerning underlying cognitive mechanisms and outcomes [45]. These models work under the assumption that a primary goal is schema formation and the activation and modification of existing schemas for learning [73]."

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5]. Interaction, unexpected events and unusual and unpleasant stimuli all tend to increase arousal, and high arousal increases the strength of emotional experience."

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter focus on retrieval of textual information objects, although a few studies focusing on other types of objects are included when appropriate" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies also focus on retrieval in the context of Internet-based systems and" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"We first review conceptualizations and definitions of engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Our examination of the literature also shows that the term engagement is increasingly being used to describe observed patterns and sets of search behaviors," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32]. This" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:183)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185)&#xD;&#xD;"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:186)&#xD;&#xD;"This is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of flow, where interest in one's task was found to be central to experiences of flow [12]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Poddar and Ruthven [37] found that participants had greater positive emotions and made more use of various search strategies when completing their own search tasks versus assigned search tasks, so the source of the task can impact user experience and effort expended." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190)&#xD;&#xD;"They also found that interest in the article and enjoyment experienced from reading it were higher when the topic of the article had a strong sentiment and negative connotations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Linking content focus and attention, Rokhlenko et al.

[39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

In" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:201)&#xD;&#xD;"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website—customization, multimodality, and contingency. Customization refers to the ability to control users' own communication setting based on their preference" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"With the rise of social media, user engagement can be equated to social media engagement, which is described in more detail in McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase's chapter in this book.

A number of measures have been suggested to capture this voluntary sharing behavior, including the number of comments and reviews on a company blog, the amount of consumer-generated media (CGM), and the frequency of forwarding the content to so" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"There are relatively few studies that propose a definition of user engagement with all of the three factors summarized above—(a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model—collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality.

Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change.

Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome.

In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30)&#xD;&#xD;"Hassenzahl [25] defined UX as "momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while interacting with a product or service"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42].

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking. Less emphasis has been placed on accompanying features of UE, though there are some exceptions. Hyder devised and tested an elaborate model of engagement antecedents (e.g. aesthetics, product involvement, depth of navigation, etc.) and consequences (e.g. intention to purchase, perceived value, brand recall, etc.) in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20 hypotheses, leading to the findings that aesthetics predicted website engagement, which consisted of positive affect, focused attention, challenge, curiosity, and involvement. Website engagement predicted consumers' perceptions of value, intention to purchase, the desire not to switch to competitors, as well as increased brand loyalty. Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"In terms of what theoretical orientations have been used in UE research, Csikszentmihalyi's Theory of Optimal Experience or Flow Theory [15] is commonly cited" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Other theoretical frameworks have included Aesthetic Theory [5], Interaction [56], Play Theory [59, 69], and Social Presence Theory [51]. In my own work [38, 42], I adopted McCarthy and Wright's Threads of Experience [33], which is rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]. In this section, I elaborate on two theoretical streams: Positive Psychology, specifically Flow Theory, and Dewey's Theory of Experience, with examples on how these theories have been applied in UE research." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;""Flow" is a state "in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Positive psychology is finding new ground in HCI with the emergence of "positive computing" [11] and its emphasis on technology for human well-being. However, Flow Theory has been employed within HCI for some time. It has been used to explore users' reactions to and motivations to use various computermediated tools and interfaces [21, 30], to understand the role of situational and personality variables in users' interactions with computers [49], and to help designers build systems or measures to encourage or capture the Flow state [20]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"While most of UE work has emphasized positive emotions, there needs to be more exploration and emphasis on the role of negative affect in UE and how this is a distinction between Flow and UE. In my work in the online news domain [40], I noted that some news readers were drawn into news items that were serious, controversial, sensational, and, frankly, grizzly;" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"performed a sentiment analysis of over 13,000 news articles and then created a corpus of 18 articles that varied in interestingness (high vs. low) and polarity (positive vs. negative). In a subsequent user study that employed eye tracking and self-report measures, the researchers found that interesting news content increased positive affect and led to more focused attention and longer fixations on new and popular news item comments" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"Results also indicated that affect," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"12 H. O'Brien interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity heightened when news content increased in sentiment but became more negative. Thus both the cognitive (interestingness) and affective (polarity) elements of content informed users' perceptions of the news reading experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Peters et al. [48] relay that interest is an affective state that is tightly coupled with attention:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;""attention is deemed to be required for varying degrees of affective processing while, conversely, emotional stimuli capture, maintain and may modulate attention" (Sect. 2.3, para 1)" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"McCay-Peet et al. [34] demonstrated this in their study of visual saliency with online news content. They found that interest in content and wanting to find out more about news items based on headlines helped predict self-reported focused attention." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Thinking about the role of interest in particular and negative emotion more broadly, there is reason to pursue how negative affect predicts and sustains engagement—and this relates to the aforementioned point about mandatory system use. As researchers and designers, we may need people to engage with things that induce discomfortable or negative emotions. This line of thinking is linked with the emerging area of "uncomfortable HCI". For instance" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Halbert and Nathan [22] explored the link between negative emotions and critical reflection for the purposes of facilitating transformative experiences around decolonizing pedagogies in the context of an online graduate course. Their work pushes back on the notion that UE should always be positive and provides a more nuanced view of UE: if UE is intended to result in learning, health behavioural change, political involvement, personal growth, etc., then we must anticipate that UE is more complicated emotionally, cognitively, and behaviourally." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:38)&#xD;&#xD;"While engagement research has already learned much from Dewey, though perhaps not articulated as such, there are two areas that have not been sufficiently explored. First, Dewey emphasizes "purpose," yet little is known about the influence of goals and tasks on user engagement. Second, Dewey stressed accumulated experience but also the role of the social enterprise; more efforts could be invested to specifically examine the role of social practices and context on user engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"Case 1: Flow, Cognitive Load, and Engagement in Adaptive Video Games Sharek [57] used Flow Theory, cognitive load theory (CLT), and engagement to test static, user-controlled, and adaptive gameplay approaches in a series of three experiments." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"grounding to situate his multi-theoretical framework. Sharek examined Flow attributes, namely, clear goals, the immediacy and quality of feedback, the balance between player skill and task challenges, control, focused concentration, loss of self-awareness and external awareness, and time distortion (p. 15). He used Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Model, which proposed that Flow increases linearly as skill and challenge increase; "" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;": :in a learning context, just being in the Flow may not be enough to push a person into situations where their full potential may be realized. This is where Flow Theory and engagement part ways. In the context of learning and serious games, being engaged requires a person to not only be in the Flow state but also to actively seek out more difficult challenges rather than simply balance their skill with the challenges of the task (p. 92)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:40)&#xD;&#xD;"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42)&#xD;&#xD;"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"I have continued to look at the validity of the Process Model of User Engagement with different applications, such as online news browsing [40]. The Process Model of UE has shown good generalizability, but I have articulated the need to incorporate task and content variables into the model [40, 41]."

Variables of interest and methodological approaches and measures should be selected with this in mind" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE. Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. • User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". • User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. • User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. • Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain. We should make an effort to isolate and measure aspects of the context to better understand influences on UE."

That is, our engineering student's willingness to engage in a learning activity at some point in the future is heavily influenced by both her current psychological state and her prior experience in similar activities" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"By extension, her perception of a current task or challenge will be shaped by what she believes the outcome will be which, in turn, is shaped by her past experience in similar situations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"Such models provide a structured way of looking at cognition in a task-oriented environment, assessing cognitive aspects of task demand and resources required to meet cognitive processing needs" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"At the heart of information processing models is the notion of resource allocation. That is, the human cognitive system functions in a constant stream of information from both the natural and human-built world" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level. To do so requires attention to, and engagement with, these information streams. Executive functions in the cognitive system make decisions as to what to attend to and, therefore, what (limited) cognitive resources should be directed to these information streams for further processing" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"A relevant framework built from this general model is Cognitive Load Theory [52, 75]. This theory is predicated on the basic information processing model of limited working memory and (effectively) unlimited long-term memory. This theory was developed specifically to better understand both how students learn and what learning environments are best suited for which kinds of learning tasks. Allied theories developed from the same general information processing model have come to similar conclusions concerning underlying cognitive mechanisms and outcomes [45]. These models work under the assumption that a primary goal is schema formation and the activation and modification of existing schemas for learning [73]."

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130)&#xD;&#xD;"Interactivity stimulates user arousal and emotion, thereby intensifying user experience [25]."

This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5].

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter focus on retrieval of textual information objects, although a few studies focusing on other types of objects are included when appropriate" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies also focus on retrieval in the context of Internet-based systems and" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"We first review conceptualizations and definitions of engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Our examination of the literature also shows that the term engagement is increasingly being used to describe observed patterns and sets of search behaviors," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32]. This" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:183)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185)&#xD;&#xD;"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:186)&#xD;&#xD;"This is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of flow, where interest in one's task was found to be central to experiences of flow [12]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Poddar and Ruthven [37] found that participants had greater positive emotions and made more use of various search strategies when completing their own search tasks versus assigned search tasks, so the source of the task can impact user experience and effort expended." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190)&#xD;&#xD;"They also found that interest in the article and enjoyment experienced from reading it were higher when the topic of the article had a strong sentiment and negative connotations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Linking content focus and attention, Rokhlenko et al.

[39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

In" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:201)&#xD;&#xD;"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website—customization, multimodality, and contingency. Customization refers to the ability to control users' own communication setting based on their preference" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"With the rise of social media, user engagement can be equated to social media engagement, which is described in more detail in McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase's chapter in this book.

A number of measures have been suggested to capture this voluntary sharing behavior, including the number of comments and reviews on a company blog, the amount of consumer-generated media (CGM), and the frequency of forwarding the content to so" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"There are relatively few studies that propose a definition of user engagement with all of the three factors summarized above—(a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model—collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

Psychological and behavioral aspects of user engagement with media are important for all areas that involve mediated content through technology.

For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality.

Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change.

Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome.

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to play, current definitions also do not distinguish UE from fun, cognitive absorption, or interest. In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30)&#xD;&#xD;"Hassenzahl [25] defined UX as "momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while interacting with a product or service"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42]. Whether we look at usability as part of the engagement equation or UE as one aspect of usability determines the kinds of outcomes we expect from users' interactions with technology and our methodological and design approaches." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31)&#xD;&#xD;"Jacques [27] proposed the following attributes of engagement with educational multimedia systems: attention, motivation, perceived time, control, needs (experiential and utilitarian), and attitudes (feelings).

Constructing a flexible definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking. Less emphasis has been placed on accompanying features of UE, though there are some exceptions. Hyder devised and tested an elaborate model of engagement antecedents (e.g. aesthetics, product involvement, depth of navigation, etc.) and consequences (e.g. intention to purchase, perceived value, brand recall, etc.) in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20 hypotheses, leading to the findings that aesthetics predicted website engagement, which consisted of positive affect, focused attention, challenge, curiosity, and involvement. Website engagement predicted consumers' perceptions of value, intention to purchase, the desire not to switch to competitors, as well as increased brand loyalty. Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32)&#xD;&#xD;"In terms of what theoretical orientations have been used in UE research, Csikszentmihalyi's Theory of Optimal Experience or Flow Theory [15] is commonly cited" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Other theoretical frameworks have included Aesthetic Theory [5], Interaction [56], Play Theory [59, 69], and Social Presence Theory [51]. In my own work [38, 42], I adopted McCarthy and Wright's Threads of Experience [33], which is rooted in John Dewey's pragmatist Philosophy of Experience [17]. In this section, I elaborate on two theoretical streams: Positive Psychology, specifically Flow Theory, and Dewey's Theory of Experience, with examples on how these theories have been applied in UE research." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;""Flow" is a state "in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Positive psychology is finding new ground in HCI with the emergence of "positive computing" [11] and its emphasis on technology for human well-being. However, Flow Theory has been employed within HCI for some time. It has been used to explore users' reactions to and motivations to use various computermediated tools and interfaces [21, 30], to understand the role of situational and personality variables in users' interactions with computers [49], and to help designers build systems or measures to encourage or capture the Flow state [20]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"While most of UE work has emphasized positive emotions, there needs to be more exploration and emphasis on the role of negative affect in UE and how this is a distinction between Flow and UE. In my work in the online news domain [40], I noted that some news readers were drawn into news items that were serious, controversial, sensational, and, frankly, grizzly;" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"performed a sentiment analysis of over 13,000 news articles and then created a corpus of 18 articles that varied in interestingness (high vs. low) and polarity (positive vs. negative). In a subsequent user study that employed eye tracking and self-report measures, the researchers found that interesting news content increased positive affect and led to more focused attention and longer fixations on new and popular news item comments" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"Results also indicated that affect," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"12 H. O'Brien interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity heightened when news content increased in sentiment but became more negative. Thus both the cognitive (interestingness) and affective (polarity) elements of content informed users' perceptions of the news reading experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Peters et al. [48] relay that interest is an affective state that is tightly coupled with attention:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;""attention is deemed to be required for varying degrees of affective processing while, conversely, emotional stimuli capture, maintain and may modulate attention" (Sect. 2.3, para 1)" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"McCay-Peet et al. [34] demonstrated this in their study of visual saliency with online news content. They found that interest in content and wanting to find out more about news items based on headlines helped predict self-reported focused attention." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Thinking about the role of interest in particular and negative emotion more broadly, there is reason to pursue how negative affect predicts and sustains engagement—and this relates to the aforementioned point about mandatory system use. As researchers and designers, we may need people to engage with things that induce discomfortable or negative emotions. This line of thinking is linked with the emerging area of "uncomfortable HCI". For instance" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Halbert and Nathan [22] explored the link between negative emotions and critical reflection for the purposes of facilitating transformative experiences around decolonizing pedagogies in the context of an online graduate course. Their work pushes back on the notion that UE should always be positive and provides a more nuanced view of UE: if UE is intended to result in learning, health behavioural change, political involvement, personal growth, etc., then we must anticipate that UE is more complicated emotionally, cognitively, and behaviourally." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:38)&#xD;&#xD;"While engagement research has already learned much from Dewey, though perhaps not articulated as such, there are two areas that have not been sufficiently explored. First, Dewey emphasizes "purpose," yet little is known about the influence of goals and tasks on user engagement. Second, Dewey stressed accumulated experience but also the role of the social enterprise; more efforts could be invested to specifically examine the role of social practices and context on user engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"Case 1: Flow, Cognitive Load, and Engagement in Adaptive Video Games Sharek [57] used Flow Theory, cognitive load theory (CLT), and engagement to test static, user-controlled, and adaptive gameplay approaches in a series of three experiments." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"grounding to situate his multi-theoretical framework. Sharek examined Flow attributes, namely, clear goals, the immediacy and quality of feedback, the balance between player skill and task challenges, control, focused concentration, loss of self-awareness and external awareness, and time distortion (p. 15). He used Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Model, which proposed that Flow increases linearly as skill and challenge increase; "" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;": :in a learning context, just being in the Flow may not be enough to push a person into situations where their full potential may be realized. This is where Flow Theory and engagement part ways. In the context of learning and serious games, being engaged requires a person to not only be in the Flow state but also to actively seek out more difficult challenges rather than simply balance their skill with the challenges of the task (p. 92)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:40)&#xD;&#xD;"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42)&#xD;&#xD;"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"I have continued to look at the validity of the Process Model of User Engagement with different applications, such as online news browsing [40]. The Process Model of UE has shown good generalizability, but I have articulated the need to incorporate task and content variables into the model [40, 41]."

Variables of interest and methodological approaches and measures should be selected with this in mind" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE. Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. • User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". • User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. • User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. • Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain. We should make an effort to isolate and measure aspects of the context to better understand influences on UE." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"Investigate the attributes, articulated in definitions and models of UE, which are most salient for engaging computer-mediated interactions in specific domains and contexts" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:47)&#xD;&#xD;"This argument could be extended to user engagement—and indeed many other areas of interest in HCI—where we are interested in not only the outcome of interaction but also the trajectory" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:53)&#xD;&#xD;"The UES is a 31-item self-report instrument designed to capture six dimensions of user engagement: perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, or the overall evaluation of the experience [34, 35, 40]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:54)&#xD;&#xD;"Applying this lens raises the importance of the temporal dimension in understanding engagement. That is, our engineering student's willingness to engage in a learning activity at some point in the future is heavily influenced by both her current psychological state and her prior experience in similar activities" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"By extension, her perception of a current task or challenge will be shaped by what she believes the outcome will be which, in turn, is shaped by her past experience in similar situations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"Such models provide a structured way of looking at cognition in a task-oriented environment, assessing cognitive aspects of task demand and resources required to meet cognitive processing needs" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"At the heart of information processing models is the notion of resource allocation. That is, the human cognitive system functions in a constant stream of information from both the natural and human-built world" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level. To do so requires attention to, and engagement with, these information streams. Executive functions in the cognitive system make decisions as to what to attend to and, therefore, what (limited) cognitive resources should be directed to these information streams for further processing" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"A relevant framework built from this general model is Cognitive Load Theory [52, 75]. This theory is predicated on the basic information processing model of limited working memory and (effectively) unlimited long-term memory. This theory was developed specifically to better understand both how students learn and what learning environments are best suited for which kinds of learning tasks. Allied theories developed from the same general information processing model have come to similar conclusions concerning underlying cognitive mechanisms and outcomes [45]. These models work under the assumption that a primary goal is schema formation and the activation and modification of existing schemas for learning [73]."

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5].

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter focus on retrieval of textual information objects, although a few studies focusing on other types of objects are included when appropriate" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies also focus on retrieval in the context of Internet-based systems and" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"We first review conceptualizations and definitions of engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Our examination of the literature also shows that the term engagement is increasingly being used to describe observed patterns and sets of search behaviors," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32]. This" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:183)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185)&#xD;&#xD;"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:186)&#xD;&#xD;"This is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of flow, where interest in one's task was found to be central to experiences of flow [12]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Poddar and Ruthven [37] found that participants had greater positive emotions and made more use of various search strategies when completing their own search tasks versus assigned search tasks, so the source of the task can impact user experience and effort expended." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190)&#xD;&#xD;"They also found that interest in the article and enjoyment experienced from reading it were higher when the topic of the article had a strong sentiment and negative connotations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Linking content focus and attention, Rokhlenko et al.

[39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

In" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:201)&#xD;&#xD;"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website—customization, multimodality, and contingency. Customization refers to the ability to control users' own communication setting based on their preference" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"With the rise of social media, user engagement can be equated to social media engagement, which is described in more detail in McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase's chapter in this book.

They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model—collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality.

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Interactivity stimulates user arousal and emotion, thereby intensifying user experience [25]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130)&#xD;&#xD;"Overall, utility and content are most important, so this view of UX is no different from conventional systems development" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:131)&#xD;&#xD;"Product framing in e-commerce sites may arise via the content in e-commerce websites," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Although there is considerable variation between models of UX, a common theme is that utility and usability, expressed as pragmatics in the inference model [29] or as effectiveness-efficiency in technology acceptance-oriented models, are dominant factors in users' overall judgement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50]. Understanding perception, i.e. how a product appears to users, involves aesthetics which is then combined with experience of interaction. Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

(O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;""Flow" is a state "in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it"" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"Positive psychology is finding new ground in HCI with the emergence of "positive computing" [11] and its emphasis on technology for human well-being. However, Flow Theory has been employed within HCI for some time. It has been used to explore users' reactions to and motivations to use various computermediated tools and interfaces [21, 30], to understand the role of situational and personality variables in users' interactions with computers [49], and to help designers build systems or measures to encourage or capture the Flow state [20]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:34)&#xD;&#xD;"While most of UE work has emphasized positive emotions, there needs to be more exploration and emphasis on the role of negative affect in UE and how this is a distinction between Flow and UE. In my work in the online news domain [40], I noted that some news readers were drawn into news items that were serious, controversial, sensational, and, frankly, grizzly;" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"performed a sentiment analysis of over 13,000 news articles and then created a corpus of 18 articles that varied in interestingness (high vs. low) and polarity (positive vs. negative). In a subsequent user study that employed eye tracking and self-report measures, the researchers found that interesting news content increased positive affect and led to more focused attention and longer fixations on new and popular news item comments" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"Results also indicated that affect," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:35)&#xD;&#xD;"12 H. O'Brien interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity heightened when news content increased in sentiment but became more negative. Thus both the cognitive (interestingness) and affective (polarity) elements of content informed users' perceptions of the news reading experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Peters et al. [48] relay that interest is an affective state that is tightly coupled with attention:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;""attention is deemed to be required for varying degrees of affective processing while, conversely, emotional stimuli capture, maintain and may modulate attention" (Sect. 2.3, para 1)" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"McCay-Peet et al. [34] demonstrated this in their study of visual saliency with online news content. They found that interest in content and wanting to find out more about news items based on headlines helped predict self-reported focused attention." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Thinking about the role of interest in particular and negative emotion more broadly, there is reason to pursue how negative affect predicts and sustains engagement—and this relates to the aforementioned point about mandatory system use. As researchers and designers, we may need people to engage with things that induce discomfortable or negative emotions. This line of thinking is linked with the emerging area of "uncomfortable HCI". For instance" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Halbert and Nathan [22] explored the link between negative emotions and critical reflection for the purposes of facilitating transformative experiences around decolonizing pedagogies in the context of an online graduate course. Their work pushes back on the notion that UE should always be positive and provides a more nuanced view of UE: if UE is intended to result in learning, health behavioural change, political involvement, personal growth, etc., then we must anticipate that UE is more complicated emotionally, cognitively, and behaviourally." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36)&#xD;&#xD;"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:38)&#xD;&#xD;"While engagement research has already learned much from Dewey, though perhaps not articulated as such, there are two areas that have not been sufficiently explored. First, Dewey emphasizes "purpose," yet little is known about the influence of goals and tasks on user engagement. Second, Dewey stressed accumulated experience but also the role of the social enterprise; more efforts could be invested to specifically examine the role of social practices and context on user engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"Case 1: Flow, Cognitive Load, and Engagement in Adaptive Video Games Sharek [57] used Flow Theory, cognitive load theory (CLT), and engagement to test static, user-controlled, and adaptive gameplay approaches in a series of three experiments." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;"grounding to situate his multi-theoretical framework. Sharek examined Flow attributes, namely, clear goals, the immediacy and quality of feedback, the balance between player skill and task challenges, control, focused concentration, loss of self-awareness and external awareness, and time distortion (p. 15). He used Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Model, which proposed that Flow increases linearly as skill and challenge increase; "" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:39)&#xD;&#xD;": :in a learning context, just being in the Flow may not be enough to push a person into situations where their full potential may be realized. This is where Flow Theory and engagement part ways. In the context of learning and serious games, being engaged requires a person to not only be in the Flow state but also to actively seek out more difficult challenges rather than simply balance their skill with the challenges of the task (p. 92)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:40)&#xD;&#xD;"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42)&#xD;&#xD;"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"I have continued to look at the validity of the Process Model of User Engagement with different applications, such as online news browsing [40]. The Process Model of UE has shown good generalizability, but I have articulated the need to incorporate task and content variables into the model [40, 41]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:43)&#xD;&#xD;"In this chapter, I have reviewed the varied definitions, theoretical orientations, and models that have been used to frame or emanated from UE research" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"different domain-specific approaches and research questions" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"based upon the studies reviewed in this chapter, with a series of unifying propositions:" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement is a process and product of people's interactions with computermediated environments. In other words, UE can be analysed during and after human-computer interactions and at the micro and macro levels. Variables of interest and methodological" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement is a process and product of people's interactions with computermediated environments. In other words, UE can be analysed during and after human-computer interactions and at the micro and macro levels. Variables of interest and methodological approaches and measures should be selected with this in mind" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE. Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. • User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". • User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. • User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. • Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain. We should make an effort to isolate and measure aspects of the context to better understand influences on UE." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:46)&#xD;&#xD;"Investigate the attributes, articulated in definitions and models of UE, which are most salient for engaging computer-mediated interactions in specific domains and contexts" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:47)&#xD;&#xD;"This argument could be extended to user engagement—and indeed many other areas of interest in HCI—where we are interested in not only the outcome of interaction but also the trajectory" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:53)&#xD;&#xD;"The UES is a 31-item self-report instrument designed to capture six dimensions of user engagement: perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, or the overall evaluation of the experience [34, 35, 40]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:54)&#xD;&#xD;"Applying this lens raises the importance of the temporal dimension in understanding engagement. That is, our engineering student's willingness to engage in a learning activity at some point in the future is heavily influenced by both her current psychological state and her prior experience in similar activities" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"By extension, her perception of a current task or challenge will be shaped by what she believes the outcome will be which, in turn, is shaped by her past experience in similar situations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:80)&#xD;&#xD;"Such models provide a structured way of looking at cognition in a task-oriented environment, assessing cognitive aspects of task demand and resources required to meet cognitive processing needs" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"At the heart of information processing models is the notion of resource allocation. That is, the human cognitive system functions in a constant stream of information from both the natural and human-built world" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level. To do so requires attention to, and engagement with, these information streams. Executive functions in the cognitive system make decisions as to what to attend to and, therefore, what (limited) cognitive resources should be directed to these information streams for further processing" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"A relevant framework built from this general model is Cognitive Load Theory [52, 75]. This theory is predicated on the basic information processing model of limited working memory and (effectively) unlimited long-term memory. This theory was developed specifically to better understand both how students learn and what learning environments are best suited for which kinds of learning tasks. Allied theories developed from the same general information processing model have come to similar conclusions concerning underlying cognitive mechanisms and outcomes [45]. These models work under the assumption that a primary goal is schema formation and the activation and modification of existing schemas for learning [73]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:82)&#xD;&#xD;"Self-determination theory and cognitive evaluation theory (a related sub-theory) posit that self-motivation is our natural state and will flourish if provided with the right conditions [21]. However, individuals will only be intrinsically motivated to do things that hold intrinsic interest to them, activities that have the appeal of novelty, challenge, and aesthetic value." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:84)&#xD;&#xD;"Expectancy-value theory [24, 82] takes the fundamental notions of selfdetermination theory and sets it within a task-driven environment where learners are setting goals at varying temporal scales" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:84)&#xD;&#xD;"Traditionally, behavioral measures are often used in conjunction with other measures to provide additional evidence rather than as a stand-alone source [18, 35" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:91)&#xD;&#xD;"They have also found that different personalities correlate with different aspects of experiences while playing; for instance, extraversion correlates with the experience of challenge while playing [38] or with measures of competence/control [37]."

Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129)&#xD;&#xD;"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130)&#xD;&#xD;"Interactivity stimulates user arousal and emotion, thereby intensifying user experience [25]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130)&#xD;&#xD;"Overall, utility and content are most important, so this view of UX is no different from conventional systems development" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:131)&#xD;&#xD;"Product framing in e-commerce sites may arise via the content in e-commerce websites," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Although there is considerable variation between models of UX, a common theme is that utility and usability, expressed as pragmatics in the inference model [29] or as effectiveness-efficiency in technology acceptance-oriented models, are dominant factors in users' overall judgement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50]. Understanding perception, i.e. how a product appears to users, involves aesthetics which is then combined with experience of interaction. Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132)&#xD;&#xD;"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5]. Interaction, unexpected events and unusual and unpleasant stimuli all tend to increase arousal, and high arousal increases the strength of emotional experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"The challenge in user engagement is to hold the user's interest and maintain arousal by interaction with optimal flow [15], which varies in difficulty and familiarity." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:133)&#xD;&#xD;"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers."

Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135)&#xD;&#xD;"An extension of presence in social presence theory [55] argues that different communication channels and representations promote a sense of social presence, i.e. awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people."

Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter focus on retrieval of textual information objects, although a few studies focusing on other types of objects are included when appropriate" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Most of the studies also focus on retrieval in the context of Internet-based systems and" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"We first review conceptualizations and definitions of engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:181)&#xD;&#xD;"Our examination of the literature also shows that the term engagement is increasingly being used to describe observed patterns and sets of search behaviors," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182)&#xD;&#xD;"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32]. This" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:183)&#xD;&#xD;"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185)&#xD;&#xD;"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:186)&#xD;&#xD;"This is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of flow, where interest in one's task was found to be central to experiences of flow [12]" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Poddar and Ruthven [37] found that participants had greater positive emotions and made more use of various search strategies when completing their own search tasks versus assigned search tasks, so the source of the task can impact user experience and effort expended." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:189)&#xD;&#xD;"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190)&#xD;&#xD;"They also found that interest in the article and enjoyment experienced from reading it were higher when the topic of the article had a strong sentiment and negative connotations" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Linking content focus and attention, Rokhlenko et al. [39] looked at how interest in peripheral content, such as advertisements, varied based on interest in the primary content on the page" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Rokhlenko et al. [39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less. If interest can serve as an indicator of engagement, then this study showed that engagement with content could lead to higher recall for peripheral images" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"This study also helps confirm that when participants are engaged, they tend to display deeper information processing behaviors such as reading and absorbing more content. If engaged participants are able to recall many different types of information, then it is possible that engagement could lend itself to expanding attentional resources." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:191)&#xD;&#xD;"Rather, a combination of novelty and familiarity can foster engagement." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:192)&#xD;&#xD;"User Engagement with Interactive Media: A Communication Perspective Jeeyun Oh and S. Shyam Sundar" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:200)&#xD;&#xD;"nteractivity is perhaps the most distinguishable feature of modern media technology that could summarize all these capabilities. Interactivity allows users to take a number of actions that control information flow instead of passively" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:200)&#xD;&#xD;"As the term itself implies, interactivity rests on the notion of active users who can control both media content and interface. Interactivity has been defined in several different ways—two-way, reciprocal communication and synchronicity [40, 50], personalization capability of the system [35, 78], the degree of user control [42, 58], and technological affordances that allow users to determine the medium, source, and message of communication [62]. In" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:201)&#xD;&#xD;"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website—customization, multimodality, and contingency. Customization refers to the ability to control users' own communication setting based on their preference" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"With the rise of social media, user engagement can be equated to social media engagement, which is described in more detail in McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase's chapter in this book. Social media engagement commonly refers to consumers'" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202)&#xD;&#xD;"180 J. Oh and S.S. Sundar voluntary information-sharing behaviors [19, 22, 24, 48]. In other words, user engagement in social networking and marketing is characterized as engagement of one user that drives the engagement of other users." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"and thereby generating "viral" messages [27]. A number of measures have been suggested to capture this voluntary sharing behavior, including the number of comments and reviews on a company blog, the amount of consumer-generated media (CGM), and the frequency of forwarding the content to so" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"There are relatively few studies that propose a definition of user engagement with all of the three factors summarized above—(a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203)&#xD;&#xD;"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model—collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

This chapter defines user engagement based on all three components—user engagement is a psychological state where the user appraises the quality of media and becomes cognitively and emotionally absorbed in media content, followed by a behavioral experience with which the user physically interacts with the interface and also socially distributes the content." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:206)&#xD;&#xD;"Some scholars argue that interactive media lead to shallow processing and superficial interaction with media content [13] and often prevent users from being immersed in a narrative [73]. By contrast, other studies have found that interactive media can promote further processing of media content when users are highly involved with the topic, by demanding more user actions and thereby resulting in systematic processing of content [41" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:206)&#xD;&#xD;"perceived usability and even" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:206)&#xD;&#xD;"preliminary assessment of the interface and lead to different levels of user engagement with content. Sundar" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:207)&#xD;&#xD;"Results from two experiments suggested that different interaction techniques indeed create significant differences in terms of the amount of interaction with the main content, users' memory and attitudes, and user engagement defined as cognitive absorption" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:207)&#xD;&#xD;"When it comes to media, visual imagery constructed in users' minds as a result of reading or watching a narrative is an indicator of the degree to which users are engaged in the story [26]. When technology engages users with a real-worldlike stimulus and elicits imagery engagement, it can persuade users—it enhances credibility of messages [57]; forms more confident, enduring, and resistant attitudes [25]; induces stronger beliefs and more positive attitudes about claims made on the website [17, 36]; and even leads to greater behavioral intention to actually perform the simulated behavior [54]." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:210)&#xD;&#xD;"Cognitive engagement can be defined as the degree to which users feel attraction, curiosity, and fun during interaction. Especially, modality interactivity is said to increase the degree to which we can mentally represent the mediated information [52, 62" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:210)&#xD;&#xD;"O'Brien and Toms [44] also point out that usability of the website is a prerequisite for user engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:210)&#xD;&#xD;"The three different indicators of user engagement—imagery engagement, cognitive engagement, and physical interaction—all led to persuasive outcomes, using a simple interactive tool, the slider." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:216)&#xD;&#xD;"This chapter has summarized previous works regarding user engagement in communications, focusing on the importance of user engagement in the context of interactive media. The three most common, significant factors to define user engagement with media are (a) cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest in the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation of users to distribute media messages." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:217)&#xD;&#xD;"cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of user engagement" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:217)&#xD;&#xD;"Message interactivity is able to provide back-and-forth interaction tools to support user-website interaction, such as real-time chat tools or interaction history, and users are particularly engaged when the website delivers the humanness of communication through message interactivity." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:217)&#xD;&#xD;"The importance of user engagement with interactive media is not only limited to the area of persuasion. Psychological and behavioral aspects of user engagement with media are important for all areas that involve mediated content through technology. Future studies ought to focus on rigorously examining the effects of specific technological variables on different aspects of user engagement. For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality. Investigations into message interactivity can explore the alluring, almost addictive, power of message exchanges through multi-platform messaging applications (e.g., KakaoTalk, WhatsApp), while" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:217)&#xD;&#xD;"A Model of Social Media Engagement: User Profiles, Gratifications, and Experiences Lori McCay-Peet and Anabel Quan-Haase" (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:222)&#xD;&#xD;"Adapting O'Brien's [45] definition of user engagement—'a quality of user experience with technology'—we define social media engagement as a quality of user experience with web-based technologies that enable users to interact with, create, and share content with individuals and organizations in their social networks." (O'Brien and Cairns 2016:223)&#xD;&#xD;"Action and participation: Social media sites allow users to perform a variety of tasks such as viewing shared content, posting content, commenting, discussing, and collaborating. 3.

To do this, we must learn existing ways of organizing and presenting data and information and develop new ones. Whether our communication tools are traditional print products, electronic products, broadcast programming, interactive experiences, or live performances makes little difference. Nor does it matter if we are employing physical or electronic devices or our own bodies and voices. The process of creating is roughly the same in any medium. The processes involved in solving problems, responding to audiences, and communicating to others are similar enough to consider them identical for the purposes of this paper. These issues apply across all types of media and experiences, because they directly address the phenomena of information overload, information anxiety, media literacy, media immersion, and technological overload-all which need better solutions. The intersection of these issues can be addressed by the process of Information Interaction Design. In other circles, it is called simply Information Design, Information Architecture, or Interaction Design, Instructional Design, or just plain Common Sense. Many people create or engineer interactions, presentations, and experiences for others. Almost all interactions- whether part of a book, a directory, a catalog, a newspaper, or a television program-can be created or addressed by one process. This process can be used to produce every CD-ROM, kiosk, presentation, game, and online service. It can also be used for every dance, music, comedy, or theater performance. While the traditions and technologies may change with every discipline, the process does not.</abstract><research-notes><style face="bold">Extracted Annotations (11/10/2017, 6:04:06 AM)</style><style face="normal">&#xD;&#xD;"One of the most important skills for almost everyone to have in the next decade and beyond will be those that allow us to create valuable, compelling, and empowering information and experiences for others" (Shedroff 2017:2)&#xD;&#xD;"The Experience of Knowledge With every experience, we acquire knowledge; it is the understanding gained through experiences—good or bad.

It is much more abstract and philosophical than other levels and less is known about how to create or effect it. Wisdom is a kind of "meta-knowledge" of processes and relationships gained through experiences. It is the result of contemplation, evaluation, retrospection, and interpretation—all of which are particularly personal processes. We cannot create wisdom like we can data and information, and we cannot share it with others like we can with knowledge. We can only create experiences that offer opportunities and describe processes. Ultimately, it is an understanding that must be gained by one's self" (Shedroff 2017:6)&#xD;&#xD;"Goals and Messages All effective communications involve defining the goals of the experience and the messages to be communicated as early in the development process as possible. These definitions drive all decisions, from Information Design, through Interaction Design, and including all aspects of Sensorial Design. Every decision, no matter how simple or mundane, should support the defined goals and messages. This ensures that inappropriate data, techniques, technology, or styles are not used. For every decision, the solution should be one that best meets the goals and messages defined at the beginning of the project. While it sounds obvious, too often the ideas that drive the presentation are at odds with the messages presented. Many times, the goals and messages stipulated by a client will not be correct. Clients are usually too close to their problems to see solutions clearly enough. It is important to uncover one or two layers of goals behind those stated and agree to these if you want to be successful. Otherwise, you may find yourself unable to satisfy a client or communicate the correct messages to your audience" (Shedroff 2017:9)</style></research-notes><remote-database-name>ResearchGate</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\6KI6BMGC\Shedroff - 2017 - Information Interaction Design A Unified Field Th.pdf</url><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\CME2WG8P\Shedroff - Information Interaction Design A Unified Field Th.pdf</url><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\TJ2YLDC5\Shedroff - Information Interaction Design A Unified Field Th.pdf</url><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\K7GBUI3I\shedroff_1999_information_interaction_design.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnston, Kim Amanda</author><author>Taylor, Maureen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The handbook of communication engagement</title></titles><pages>603</pages><keywords><keyword>★ starred</keyword><keyword>engagement</keyword><keyword>proposal</keyword><keyword>Social Science / Media Studies</keyword><keyword>Business &amp; Economics / Public Relations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons</publisher><isbn>978-1-119-16751-8 978-1-119-16752-5 978-1-119-16760-0</isbn><abstract>"Sets out to ground and orientate the student through a broad range of specially commissioned chapters, while also providing the more experienced scholar and teacher with a convenient and comprehensive overview of the latest trends and critical directions"-- "A comprehensive volume that offers the most current thinking on the practice and theory of engagement With contributions from an international panel of leaders representing diverse academic and professional fields The Handbook of Communication Engagement brings together in one volume writings on both the theory and practice of engagementin todays organizations and societies.

(DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"THE MEASUREMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IS) success or effectiveness is critical to our understanding of the value and efficacy of IS management actions and IS investments" (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"In 1992, we published a paper [8] in which we attempted to bring some awareness and structure to the "dependent variable"—IS success—in IS research." (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"We proposed a taxonomy and an interactive model (hereafter referred to as the "D&amp;M IS Success Model") as frameworks for conceptualizing and operationalizing IS success." (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"The D&amp;M IS Success Model" (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"The D&amp;M IS Success Model, though published in 1992, was based on theoretical and empirical IS research conducted by a number of researchers in the 1970s and 1980s. The" (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"Based on the communications research of Shannon and Weaver [43] and the information "influence" theory of Mason [31], as well as empirical management information systems (MIS) research studies from 1981-87, a comprehensive, multidimensional model of IS success was postulated. Shannon and Weaver defined the technical level of communications as the accuracy and efficiency of the communication system that produces information. The semantic level is the success of the information in conveying the intended meaning. The effectiveness level is the effect of the information on the receiver." (DeLone and McLean 2003:10)&#xD;&#xD;"Information Quality—Individual Impacts" (DeLone and McLean 2003:15)&#xD;&#xD;"The four studies [10, 41, 50, 57] that tested the relationship between "information quality" and "individual impacts" found the association to be significant. Information quality was measured in terms of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, relevance, and consistency" (DeLone and McLean 2003:15)&#xD;&#xD;"Individual impact was measured in terms decision-making performance, job effectiveness, and quality of work." (DeLone and McLean 2003:15)&#xD;&#xD;"The D&amp;M IS success taxonomy and its six success categories are based on a process model of IS" (DeLone and McLean 2003:15)&#xD;&#xD;"In addition, we argue that the six dimensions are interrelated, resulting in a success model that indicates that causality flows in the same direction as the information process." (DeLone and McLean 2003:15)&#xD;&#xD;"The creation of the D&amp;M IS Success Model was driven by a process understanding of IS and their impacts. This process model has just three components: the creation of a system, the use of the system, and the consequences of this system use. Each of these steps is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the resultant outcome(s)." (DeLone and McLean 2003:16)&#xD;&#xD;"System Use" (DeLone and McLean 2003:16)&#xD;&#xD;"System Use as a Success Measure" (DeLone and McLean 2003:16)&#xD;&#xD;"Role of Context" (DeLone and McLean 2003:17)&#xD;&#xD;"This success model clearly needs further development and validation before it could serve as a basis for the selection of appropriate IS measures" (DeLone and McLean 2003:17)&#xD;&#xD;"Independent Versus Dependent Variables" (DeLone and McLean 2003:17)&#xD;&#xD;"of the User Information Satisfaction (UIS) instrument [2, 19]" (DeLone and McLean 2003:20)&#xD;&#xD;"UIS continues to be the most commonly used and developed success measure; but, when used alone, it cannot fully measure IS success." (DeLone and McLean 2003:20)&#xD;&#xD;"Straub et al. [46] studied 458 users of a voice mail system and found that self-reported systems usage and computer-recorded usage were not correlated. Their findings suggest that self-reported system usage and computer-recorded usage should both be measured in empirical studies because the two do not necessarily correlate with one another." (DeLone and McLean 2003:20)&#xD;&#xD;"Agarwal and Prasad [1] studied both initial system usage and intentions of future use and found that different factors affected initial use versus future use of the World Wide Web. Similarly, Karahanna et al. [24] found different factors were associated with intention to use windows between potential adopters and continuing users. These two empirical studies demonstrate that early use and continued use can differ." (DeLone and McLean 2003:21)&#xD;&#xD;"usage measures (i.e., "system use"), perceptual measures (i.e., "user satisfaction")," (DeLone and McLean 2003:21)&#xD;&#xD;"Some have developed and proposed alternate frameworks for measuring IS effectiveness. Grover et al. used an alternative, theoretically based perspective (theory of organizational effectiveness) "to build a theoretically-based construct space for IS effectiveness which complements and extends the [DeLone &amp; McLean] IS Success Model" [13, p. 178]. Based on unit-of-analysis and evaluation-type context dimensions, the authors created six IS effectiveness categories. The six effectiveness classes are infusion measures (i.e., "organizational impacts" in the D&amp;M IS Success Model), market measures (not covered in the D&amp;M IS Success Model), economic measures (i.e., "organizational impacts"), usage measures (i.e., "system use"), perceptual measures (i.e., "user satisfaction"), and productivity measures (i.e., "individual impact"). Their framework considers "system quality" and "information quality" to be antecedent effectiveness constructs, whereas the D&amp;M IS Success Model considers them to be important dimensions of success itself." (DeLone and McLean 2003:21)&#xD;&#xD;"As discussed earlier, quality has three major dimensions: "information quality," "systems quality," and "service quality." Each should be measured—or controlled for—separately, because singularly or jointly, they will affect subsequent "use" and "user satisfaction." (DeLone and McLean 2003:23)&#xD;&#xD;""Intention to use" is an attitude, whereas "use" is a behavior" (DeLone and McLean 2003:23)&#xD;&#xD;"attitudes, and their links with behavior," (DeLone and McLean 2003:23)&#xD;&#xD;"attitudes, and their links with behavior, are notoriously difficult to measure; and many researchers may choose to stay with "use," but hopefully with a more informed understanding of it." (DeLone and McLean 2003:23)&#xD;&#xD;"As was true in the original formulation of the D&amp;M Model, "use" and "user satisfaction" are closely interrelated. "Use" must precede "user satisfaction" in a process sense, but positive experience with "use" will lead to greater "user satisfaction" in a causal sense. Similarly, increased "user satisfaction" will lead to increased "intention to use," and thus "use."" (DeLone and McLean 2003:23)&#xD;&#xD;"Updated D&amp;M IS Success Model" (DeLone and McLean 2003:24)&#xD;&#xD;"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN GENERAL, and the Internet in particular, is having a dramatic impact on business operations." (DeLone and McLean 2003:24)&#xD;&#xD;""System quality," in the Internet environment, measures the desired characteristics of an e-commerce system. Usability, availability, reliability, adaptability," (DeLone and McLean 2003:24)&#xD;&#xD;"THE DELONE AND MCLEAN MODEL OF INFORMATION SYSTEM SUCCESS     25 and response time (e.g., download time) are examples of qualities that are valued by users of an e-commerce system." (DeLone and McLean 2003:25)&#xD;&#xD;"Information quality" captures the e-commerce content issue. Web content should be personalized, complete, relevant, easy to understand, and secure if we expect prospective buyers or suppliers to initiate transactions via the Internet and return to our site on a regular basis." (DeLone and McLean 2003:25)&#xD;&#xD;"Usage" measures everything from a visit to a Web site, to navigation within the site, to information retrieval, to execution of a transaction" (DeLone and McLean 2003:25)&#xD;&#xD;"User satisfaction" remains an important means of measuring our customers' opinions of our e-commerce system and should cover the entire customer experience cycle from information retrieval through purchase, payment, receipt, and service." (DeLone and McLean 2003:25)&#xD;&#xD;"Net benefits" are the most important success measures as they capture the balance of positive and negative impacts of the e-commerce on our customers, suppliers, employees, organizations, markets, industries, economies, and even our societies. Have Internet purchases saved individual consumers time and money? Have the benefits such as larger markets, supply chain efficiencies, and customer responsiveness yielded positive net benefits for an organization? Have countries' investments in e-commerce infrastructure yielded a net positive growth in the gross national product? Have societal investments in e-commerce infrastructure and education reduced poverty? "Net benefits" measures must be determined by context and objectives for each e-commerce investment. Thus, there will be a variety of e-commerce "net benefits" measures, but many will be the same ones that have been developed and tested for IS investments in general."

The succeeding ten years have seen tremendous progress in terms of the impacts of IS on business and society as well as progress in IS research. In light of this progress and change, we felt compelled to review, evaluate, and update our success model." (DeLone and McLean 2003:26)&#xD;&#xD;"The complex, multidimensional, and interdependent nature of IS success requires careful attention to the definition and measurement of each dimension of this dependent variable. It is important to measure the possible interactions among these success dimensions in order to isolate the effect of various independent variables with one or more of these dependent success dimensions." (DeLone and McLean 2003:27)&#xD;&#xD;"For each research endeavor, the selection of IS success dimensions and measures should be contingent on the objectives and context of the empirical investigation, but, where possible, tested and proven measures should be used." (DeLone and McLean 2003:27)&#xD;&#xD;"Despite the multidimensional and contingent nature of IS success, an attempt should be made to reduce significantly the number of measures used to measure IS success so that research results can be compared and findings validated" (DeLone and McLean 2003:27)</style></research-notes><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2003.11045748</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\IAKNRJB4\2003 - The DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-21 21:39:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petter, Stacie</author><author>Carter, Michelle</author><author>Randolph, Adriane</author><author>Lee, Allen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Desperately Seeking the Information in Information Systems Research</title><secondary-title>ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>10-18</pages><volume>49</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>User Behavior</keyword><keyword>★ starred</keyword><keyword>❓ Multiple DOI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-07-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00950033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3242734.3242736</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>@article{petter2018desperately,&#xD;  title={Desperately Seeking the Information in Information Systems Research},&#xD;  author={Petter, Stacie and Carter, Michelle and Randolph, Adriane and Lee, Allen},&#xD;  journal={ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems},&#xD;  volume={49},&#xD;  number={3},&#xD;  pages={10--18},&#xD;  year={2018},&#xD;  publisher={ACM}&#xD;}</research-notes><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3242734.3242736</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>G:\My Drive\Zotero\Desktop17\storage\RPL6MRNK\Petter et al. - 2018 - Desperately Seeking the Information in Information.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Desperately%20Seeking%20the%20Information%20in%20Information%20Systems%20Research&amp;rft.jtitle=ACM%20SIGMIS%20Database%3A%20the%20DATABASE%20for%20Advances%20in%20Information%20Systems&amp;rft.volume=49&amp;rft.issue=3&amp;rft.aufirst=Stacie&amp;rft.aulast=Petter&amp;rft.au=Stacie%20Petter&amp;rft.au=Michelle%20Carter&amp;rft.au=Adriane%20Randolph&amp;rft.au=Allen%20Lee&amp;rft.date=2018&amp;rft.pages=10-18&amp;rft.spage=10&amp;rft.epage=18</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-12-05 18:27:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O’Brien, Heather L.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Filimowicz, Michael</author><author>Tzankova, Veronika</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A Holistic Approach to Measuring User Engagement</title><secondary-title>New Directions in Third Wave Human-Computer Interaction: Volume 2 - Methodologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Directions in Third Wave Human-Computer Interaction: Volume 2 - Methodologies</full-title></periodical><pages>81-102</pages><keywords><keyword>engagement</keyword><keyword>proposal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cham</pub-location><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><isbn>978-3-319-73373-9 978-3-319-73374-6</isbn><abstract>This chapter provides an overview of methodological approaches and current work in the evaluation of user engagement (UE). Using a series of propositions about the nature of engagement, I review a selection of recent research that utilizes varied methodological approaches to study UE in various human-computer interaction settings. The propositions and the reviewed literature are used to propose a methodological framework to guide decision making and reﬂection regarding how UE will be evaluated in a given context. The chapter concludes with reﬂections on broader issues related to how researchers’ methodological stances inﬂuence the evaluation of UE. Overall, the chapter argues that UE should be measured using a thoughtful mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, considering the particulars of the use context, and balancing established and emerging subjective and objective metrics.</abstract><research-notes><style face="bold">Extracted Annotations (2/26/2019, 3:17:07 PM)</style><style face="normal">&#xD;&#xD;"Each of these methods has its benefits and drawbacks."
