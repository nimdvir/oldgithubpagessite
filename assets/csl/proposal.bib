  abstract = {In recent years, the term user engagement (UE) has been increasingly used to describe users' interactions with Information and communication technologies (ICT). Given the competition for users' attention and interest, it is agreed that technologies must engage users to be successful. However, current research is unstructured and spread across various disciplines, leading ‎to wide-ranging, and sometimes disparate, perspectives, vocabularies, and measurement ‎methodologies‎. The purpose of this paper is to critically deconstruct the concept of user engagement to mitigate the discrepancies and improve current knowledge. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review, we synthesize established theories and prior research to conceptually and operationally defined engagement. By bringing together interdisciplinary perspectives and insights, we also identify antecedents (determinants), attributes and outcomes of user engagement. The review concludes by proposing an agenda for future research in this area.},
