  ## Reviewer 1 

### 1\. Instructions

Your main purpose in composing this review is to provide concrete ideas and suggestions to the author (not to the conference organizer). As you compose your thoughts, please consider yourself a mentor. Word your suggestions in an ego-acceptable manner, such as "The paper would be stronger by ....". The authors are your colleagues.

The system protects itself from hackers who try to inject code into forms. It does this by not allowing text that looks like HTML. If copy and paste does not work (you get an "An error occurred while processing your request." error), remove any HTML symbols, such as greater than sign "<" or other non-standard characters from what you are copying.

Please use line numbers to identify for the author the line(s) that you refer to in your review. We have no way to get a "Tracked Changes" file to the author, so instead use line numbers in your online review.

### 2\. Paper Subject Matter

#### Give a brief summary of the paper in three to five sentences. 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

This paper examines whether changing specific words in article titles with "sticky words" can engage users better in three different ways: 1\. Motivation to read the paper, 2\. Evaluation whether the paper is more interesting 3\. Retention - do they have better recollection of the paper.
  
  

#### For whom is the paper written? That is, who is the audience? Is the topic interesting to you? Would it be of interest to the colleagues attending the conference? Why? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

This paper should interest anyone who wants to improve user engagement. 

#### What in the paper needs to be fixed to make it suitable for an international audience?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

It is appropriate for international audiences.

### 3\. Research Paper Quality

The main function of this section is to help you think about and develop the ideas that you will use in the next section where you inform the author of ways to make the paper even better. Do remember that you are writing your suggestions for and to the author.

#### To what extent is the research grounded in the past work of others? 
#### To improve the paper, what other important past research should it reference? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The paper is grounded in a reasonable literature review. 

#### How sound is the research approach and method? How can it be improved? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I am not sure the method truly addresses the aim of the paper. In my opinion, **the introduction/title promises a lot more than what is actually tested.** 

#### Are the findings well supported? If not, what do you suggest the author do?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The findings are only partly supported. The first research question is addressed properly. The second one much less so. You write that you had to manually ensure that switching the words in the title did not alter the meaning. You then conclude that it is yet not possible to automate the process. Okay. However, to convince the reader that this is the case you need to provide statistics about how many times did the automatic change of the words alter the original title meaning. How many times it did not? Provide examples to the former. 
  
  
Also, there is no statistical analysis of the results of Figure 3 (t-test, etc.). 

#### Are the conclusions drawn valid? Give examples where conclusions go beyond what the study found.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

See above. 

#### How can the methodology be improved?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

First, limit the scope of the paper. It discusses how titles of papers can be improved for better user engagement. From the paper title and beginning of the Introduction I expected much more. 
  
  
Add statistical tests to improve the analysis. 

#### What contribution does the paper make? To what extent are findings novel?

The paper IS interesting. It goes to show how title wordings must be used. It shows that the field of computational linguistics promises very interesting applications. 

#### Do the authors relate the findings of this paper back to the prior work of others? If not, what other studies should they consider?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

They do not discuss the results, so there is no attempt to relate it to other studies. 

### 4\. Suggestions and Decision

This is the most important of all the sections. Please summarize your suggestions above, mentioning the positive aspects of the paper and giving concise direction for how to make it even better.

#### What are the most important things that the manuscript's authors could do to strengthen the work? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The topic of the paper is very interesting. I am not sure the title is suitable. Certainly, you could use your own research to improve it... :).
  
  
Moreover, i was fascinated with how you use various databases to identify the sticky words. 
  
  
I was quite disappointed, however, with the results and their (lack of) analysis. Surely, you could have done more. Possibly, this is still a work-in-progress and you plan to expand this study. Once expanded and analyzed more thoroughly this could certainly be a very interesting paper. 

#### How can the author improve the development of the paper? Development refers to moving from one topic to the next in a logical manner.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Typically research questions are the RESULT OF the Literature Review. In this paper the order is reversed and doesn't make sense. 

#### Please note any sentences that don't make sense? Are there any other major grammatical errors that hamper understanding? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

In the Abstract: The second part of this sentence is unintelligible: 
  
  
Impact on Society: This research can be used as an important starting point for understanding the phenomenon of digital information interactions and behavior, the factors that promote and facilitates them, and in the development of a broad framework for systematically evaluation, optimization, and creation effective digital content.
  
  
  
I found many other typos/errors. Here are some:
  
  
Abstract, Contribution: "con-tent" should be "content"
  
Abstract, Recommendations for researchers: "Recommendation" should be "Recommendations", "our" should be "Our"
  
RQ2: remove the commas. 
  
Rows: 107, 108, 112: Within 5 rows you switched between 3 writing styles. We hypothesized (past active tense), We also argue (present active), "was employed" (past passive). I suggest consistency in style. 
  
Row 133: "in-formation" should be "information"
  
Row 138: The reference is bold capitalized. Why? Also, capitalize "knowledge"
  
  
  
  

#### Does that abstract convey the essence of the entire paper (as it should)? If not, please provide the author with concrete suggestions. The abstract should summarize the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusions sections. Does the Introduction introduce the topic, and so on? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

See comments above. The abstract is fine. 

#### Finally, what else do you recommend to the authors on how to make this paper even better?

> Thank you. I enjoyed the paper.

  ## Reviewer 3
  ### 2\. Paper Subject Matter

Give a brief summary of the paper in three to five sentences. 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Understanding user experience by using specific key words to improve interaction. "Sticky Words" (as described) offer a broader based of potential interaction from the user, application for different business segments is offered along with a model for use.

For whom is the paper written? That is, who is the audience? Is the topic interesting to you? Would it be of interest to the colleagues attending the conference? Why? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Would it be of interest to the colleagues attending the conference? Why?
  
The audience appears to focus on website administrators and marketing professionals who work with website development. This is a very interesting topic, offering insights about the linguistics of user engagement, how to formulate an effective content strategy and how sticky words impact such engagement. This absolutely would be a very powerful and strong research interest to my colleagues since we all struggle with finding frameworks to pursue emotional stimulation for our customers. I am very impressed by the application, framework and overall descriptions offered.

What in the paper needs to be fixed to make it suitable for an international audience?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

After going over this paper three separate times, the strength in writing, suitability for an international audience is present. I say this with great confidence and strongly feel this research is ready to move forward. 

### 3\. Research Paper Quality

The main function of this section is to help you think about and develop the ideas that you will use in the next section where you inform the author of ways to make the paper even better. Do remember that you are writing your suggestions for and to the author.

To what extent is the research grounded in the past work of others? 
To improve the paper, what other important past research should it reference? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Research is well grounded in the past work of others. With the relative lack of past literature in this specific area (I looked, and struggled to find anything more relevant than what is presented) there is a big gap being filled for this area. I would suggest a few additional articles that may provide even more strength to the research such as:
  
  
  
HUMPHREYS, ASHLEE; JEN-HUI WANG, REBECCA. Journal of Consumer Research. Apr2018, Vol. 44 Issue 6, p1274-1306\. 33p. 1 Diagram, 2 Charts. DOI: 10.1093/jcr/ucx104
  
  
Balducci, Bitty; Marinova, Detelina. JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE; JUL 2018; 46; 4; p557-p590

How sound is the research approach and method? 
How can it be improved? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Research approach is solid, explaining effective methods with rational outcome variables. This has to be one of the strongest and well-grounded approaches I have seen from a review.

Are the findings well supported? If not, what do you suggest the author do?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Without a doubt the author has really managed to touch on all attributes of linguistic computation in a way that offers deep insights to effective sticky word usage and application.

Are the conclusions drawn valid? Give examples where conclusions go beyond what the study found.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Yes. The conclusions are valid, flow effectively with the research topic, focus and method.
  

How can the methodology be improved?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

There is no suggestions for this.

What contribution does the paper make? To what extent are findings novel?

With such an exponential growth in data, usage and linguistic application of systemic words, this research will build into a new field of exploration for decades to come. I agree that additional linguistic factors should be explored in the future but his research offers a vastly amazing "first step" in discovery in the future.
  

Do the authors relate the findings of this paper back to the prior work of others? If not, what other studies should they consider?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Yes. The author applies past literature in a way that connects all research findings, application effectively. 
  

### 4\. Suggestions and Decision

This is the most important of all the sections. Please summarize your suggestions above, mentioning the positive aspects of the paper and giving concise direction for how to make it even better.

What are the most important things that the manuscript's authors could do to strengthen the work? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The work is strong, there is a niche focus, well documented analysis and frankly I am floured at just how powerful the work is.

How can the author improve the development of the paper? Development refers to moving from one topic to the next in a logical manner.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

the logic moves with an application and effectiveness that leaves little to develop aside from what has already been described.

Please note any sentences that don't make sense? Are there any other major grammatical errors that hamper understanding? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Line 131 "Qualtric.com" (could not find this web link. Sentences are sound, grammar is correct.

Does that abstract convey the essence of the entire paper (as it should)? If not, please provide the author with concrete suggestions. The abstract should summarize the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusions sections.
Does the Introduction introduce the topic, and so on? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Yes it does, clearly.

  ## Reviewer 2
  
  ### 2\. Paper Subject Matter

Give a brief summary of the paper in three to five sentences. 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The paper tries to discuss a new approach to improve the user interaction with digital content based on the wordings used. It proposes a concept of "sticky words" to digital content for better UE and also a method to improve the "stickiness" by systematically changing the nature of the words to improve novelty, familiarity and the polarity. The processing of the sticky words dataset were carried out using semantic substitution, term frequency based selection and sentiment analysis. It suggests to evaluate the validity, reliability and the generalizability of the model in other contexts. 

For whom is the paper written? That is, who is the audience? Is the topic interesting to you? Would it be of interest to the colleagues attending the conference? Why? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The paper is written for content developers, informaticians, brand managers, policy makers and marketers. 
  
  
It was an interesting topic for me and I enjoy going through the content. I also think the conference attendees will like it because of few reasons: methodology suggested has some novelty, there is a possibility to carry out a similar study in different contexts hence collaborations might work-out

What in the paper needs to be fixed to make it suitable for an international audience?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

While most of the parts are written well I think following areas can be improved. 
  
  
1\. Literature review
  
While the authors have covered a lot in this areas with a solid component on theoretical background, I would like to see more details pertaining to the methodology adopted/used. Specially the way in which they derive 3 attributes out of 6-4 of the PES/modified PES. The point here is, why only 3 not 4 or 5 or 6\. On the other hand I would like to see all the possible options for computational linguistic processes to maintain the attribute coherence and why the authors have chosen the aforementioned processes. However, I really appreciate the effort in lit review.
  
  
2\. Results section
  
As the study is quantitative in nature it is recommended to use a proper reporting standard of such a study. I would like to suggest that the statistical data to be presented (i.e. paired sample T test value, how significant, alpha level used ans so on). Please refer to a standard journal article. 
  
  
3\. Discussion of the results
  
I would have loved to see the discussion of the important results. It would have added value if my earlier point was fulfilled, followed up with the discussion section. 

### 3\. Research Paper Quality

The main function of this section is to help you think about and develop the ideas that you will use in the next section where you inform the author of ways to make the paper even better. Do remember that you are writing your suggestions for and to the author.

To what extent is the research grounded in the past work of others? 
To improve the paper, what other important past research should it reference? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

The paper highlights the past studies and theoretical aspects in relation to rationalization of the topic. I like to suggest you to discuss more about the UES/modified UES and computational linguistic options in the review in detail.
  

How sound is the research approach and method? 
How can it be improved? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I think the methodology looks novel and sound. I would like to suggest you complete the flow diagram of the steps upto the evaluation study. 
  
  
Evaluation study: 
  
Furthermore please mention about the sample size calculation , how the tool was selected and validated to your context and the method of analysis based on the tool in detail. 

Are the findings well supported? If not, what do you suggest the author do?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Although the findings are aligned with the RQs, the presentation is very brief, not elaborated enough. I suggest to illustrate and demonstrate the findings of statistical analysis to give an answer to the question. Furthermore I would like to see more referencing (as how you have done well for the review section) to support/in contrast to the findings. 

Are the conclusions drawn valid? Give examples where conclusions go beyond what the study found.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I think the conclusions drawn are valid and based on the results. However I think you could have concluded on few more aspects of UE based on the results of the evaluation study. The different dimensions of information interaction behavior when treatment to the text was done would have given more in-depth understanding of the UE. 

How can the methodology be improved?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

Please refer to my above comments. 

What contribution does the paper make? To what extent are findings novel?

You paper gives a good methodology to treat the information presented digitally, in order to improve the UE. Although you have not discusses in detail, I think this can be used very effectively in specific subject areas where information presentation and the message matters i.e. healthcare
  
  
I would like to suggest you to develop a simple framework/model (with symbolic presentation) as to how people can improve digital information in a systematic way. It will add value to your conclusions. 

Do the authors relate the findings of this paper back to the prior work of others? If not, what other studies should they consider?
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I think they can improve on their writing by relating it to prior work. Especially the semantic substitution/sentiment analysis in similar work can be related to show the effectiveness in methodology. 
  
Also the studies using UES can be related to compare/contrast the findings when you are reporting them. 

### 4\. Suggestions and Decision

This is the most important of all the sections. Please summarize your suggestions above, mentioning the positive aspects of the paper and giving concise direction for how to make it even better.

What are the most important things that the manuscript's authors could do to strengthen the work? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

1\. Revise the lit review with the suggestions given before
  
2\. Revise the results section giving more depth in analysis
  
(3\. Adding a discussion section/elaborate on results): Just think about, no need to agree with me
  
4\. Relating to findings from the rest of the world in your discussion section

How can the author improve the development of the paper? Development refers to moving from one topic to the next in a logical manner.
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I think the logical order is good. No need to revise other than the issues noted above. 

Please note any sentences that don't make sense? Are there any other major grammatical errors that hamper understanding? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

I could not find major issues in grammar/spelling/English language usage.
  
  
However please note the followings
  
  
1\. Is/are use- please review
  
ex. in the abstract: interactions with digital information is--\> should be are
  
  
2\. In the abstract con-tent is used instead of content in 2 places
  
  
3\. Use of prepositions has to be revised
  
ex. line 9 --\> should be with an increasing
  
line 24--\> an emotion
  
  
I would suggest you to review language with a professional software like Grammarly and/or with few of your peers who are good in language. The secret is , sometimes its very difficult for us to see the holes in our writing compared to a second person. 
  

Does that abstract convey the essence of the entire paper (as it should)? If not, please provide the author with concrete suggestions. The abstract should summarize the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusions sections.
Does the Introduction introduce the topic, and so on? 
![](https://www.informingscience.org/Content/Images/info.png)

A good abstract. Just include additions to the abstract. 

Finally, what else do you recommend to the authors on how to make this paper even better?

It covers an important aspect and the methods used seems novel combination. 
  
  
Apart from the suggestions above would like to suggest again the presentation of a small framework to follow in similar contexts. 
  
  
Please revise the topic as there are certain areas of the topic not supported by the findings/conclusions. i.e. decision making (may be I have lost the track of it or not presented in results section)
